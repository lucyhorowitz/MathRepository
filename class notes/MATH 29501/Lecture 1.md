### Defined
- [[p-adic field]] (started)
- [[absolute value]]
- [[positive definite]]
- [[norm|triangle inequality]]
- [[non-Archimedean absolute value]]
- [[absolute value induces a topology]]
### Stated
- [[absolute value on F is non-Archimedean iff image of Z is less than 1]]
- [[absolute value on R is Archimedean]]
- [[all non-Archimedean triangles are isosceles]]
### Proved
- [[absolute values on finite fields are trivial]]
- [[strict equality on ultrametric equality for non-Archimedian absolute value]]
