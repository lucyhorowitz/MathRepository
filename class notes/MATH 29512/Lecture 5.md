### Defined
- [[upper central series]]
- [[nilpotent group]]
- [[lower central series]]
### Stated
- [[subgroups in upper central series are characteristic]]
- [[abelian groups are nilpotent]]
- [[subgroups in lower central series are characteristic]]
- [[a group is nilpotent iff its lower central series terminates]]
### Proved
- [[a group is solvable iff derived series terminates]]
- [[nilpotent implies solvable]]
