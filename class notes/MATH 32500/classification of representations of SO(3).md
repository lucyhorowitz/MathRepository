## Theorem
Let $SO(3)$ be the [[special orthogonal group]] of $\mathbb R^3$. Then for each odd integer $m$, there exists a [[group representation|representation]] of dimension $m$ which is unique up to [[morphism of group representations|isomorphism]]. Moreover, there are no [[group representation|representations]] of even dimension.
