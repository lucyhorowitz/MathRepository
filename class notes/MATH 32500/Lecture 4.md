## Lecture 4
- proved [[Haar integral over compact space is continuous]]
- proved [[norm inequality of Haar integral]]
- proved [[right and left group actions commute]]
- stated [[Haar measure|Haar's theorem]]

From now on, we consider only [[compact]] [[group|groups]] $G$.

- proved [[over a compact group, left-invariant measures are also right-invariant]]
