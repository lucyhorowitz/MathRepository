### Linear Algebra Done Wrong
- proved [[zero vector corresponds to zero in ground field]]
- proved [[any set of vectors containing zero is linearly dependent]]
- proved [[subsets of linearly independent sets are linearly independent]]
- proved [[union of subspaces is a subspace iff the union is one of them]]
### Problem 3
- proved [[every vector space admits a basis]]
