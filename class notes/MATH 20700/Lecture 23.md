### Proved
- [[linear transformation that scales orthonormal basis is compact if and only if scaling sequence goes to zero]]
- [[compact linear transformations send weakly convergent sequences to strongly convergent sequences]]
### Stated
- [[linear transformation is compact if and only if image of closed unit ball is totally bounded]]
- [[linear transformation is compact if and only if image of bounded sequence has strongly convergent subsequence]]
### Examples
- [[self-adjoint linear transformation with no eigenvalues]]
