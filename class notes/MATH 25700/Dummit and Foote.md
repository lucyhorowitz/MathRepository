- [[conjugacy classes]]
- [[number of conjugates of a subgroup is is the index of the normalizer]]
- [[cardinality of conjugacy class is index of centralizer]]
- [[Class Equation]]
- [[p-groups have nontrivial center]]
- [[classification of groups of order p^2]]
- [[cycle decomposition of conjugates]]
- [[cycle type]]
- [[partition of an integer]]
- [[elements of Sn are conjugate iff they have the same cycle type]]
- [[conjugacy classes of Sn is number of partitions of n]]
