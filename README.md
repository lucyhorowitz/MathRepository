# MathRepository
 
This repository contains my notes from my (ongoing) undergraduate math studies at the University of Chicago. They consist of largely atomic definitions, results, and a few examples. 

## The Notes

The notes are connected by Obsidian's markdown links. I have tried to be as dense as possible, linking to every definition and every result used/stated/cited in any given note. 

### Courses

## Theorems

Sometimes the theorems have proofs associated with them, but in a lot of cases I did not have time to copy proofs from my hand-written notes. These theorem notes are marked with #write_proof in the hopes that I will someday sit down and write the proofs. This definitely makes the linking less dense than I would like, so sometimes when I am typing my notes I will link to definitions and results used in the proof without actually writing the proof to help boost link density. 

## spaCy

I have run spaCy v3.4 on the definitions and put the results into CoNLL-U format so that once I figure out how, I can run some analyses on this to help make NLP better for math. 

### Cleaning up

The notes are Markdown math notes so naturally they include Markdown and a *lot* of LaTeX. I removed certain symbols (pipes, dollar signs, brackets, octothorpes, newlines, backslashes) and words/phrases that generally do not make up the content of the notes (metadata, links, font names)
