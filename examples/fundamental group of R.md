## Theorem
The [[fundamental group]] of $\mathbb R$ is $0$.
## Proof
Choose $0$ as a convenient basepoint. Then we can define a [[homotopy]] $k:\mathbb R\times I\to \mathbb R$ by $k(s,t) = (1-t)s$ from the [[identity function]] to the zero function. Given a [[loop]] $f:I\to \mathbb R$ at $0$, we can define another [[homotopy]] $h(x,t) = k(f(s),t))$. Then $f$ is [[homotopy|homotopic]] to the constant map, and thus the [[fundamental group]] is trivial.
