## Construction
Let $p$ and $q$ be prime numbers such that $p\equiv 1\pmod q$. Thus $q$ is a prime number that divides $p-1$, which is the [[order of a group|order]] of the multiplicative [[abelian]] [[group]] on the [[field]] $\mathbb F_p^\times$. By [[Cauchy's theorem]], there exists an element $a\in \mathbb F_p$ of [[order of a group element|order]] $q$. Let $\text{Aff}(\mathbb F_p)$ [[group action|act]] on $\mathbb F_p$ and consider the [[subgroup]] $\langle m_a,t_1\rangle$ [[generating set of a group|generated]] by $m_a$ and $t_1 \in \text{Aff}(\mathbb F_p)$ (multiplication by $a$ and translation by $1$, respectively). Then $\langle m_a,t_1\rangle$ is a noncommutative group of [[order of a group|order]] $pq$.
## Proof
First, note that $t_1m_a(x)= ax+1$ while $m_at_1(x) = ax+a$. These are not equal because $a$ cannot be equal to $1$, otherwise it would have [[order of a group|order]] $p$, not order $q$. The elements $t_bm_{a^r}$ for $b\in \mathbb F_p$ and $r\in\{0,\dots, q-1\}$ are exactly the elements of $\langle m_a,t_1\rangle$, and there are clearly $pq$ of these.
