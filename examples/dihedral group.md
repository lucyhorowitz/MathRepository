The **dihedral [[group]]** $D_{2n}$ is the [[group]] with [[group presentation|presentation]] $$D_{2n} = \langle r,s \mid \text{ord}(r) = 2n, \text{ord}(s) = 2, srs = r^{-1}\rangle$$ where $\text{ord}(x)$ denotes the [[order of a group element|order]] of the element $x$ in the group. These groups always have even [[order of a group|order]] and they are the symmetries of $n$-gons so it is conventional to denote them $D_{2n}$, just in case you thought that was ridiculous.
