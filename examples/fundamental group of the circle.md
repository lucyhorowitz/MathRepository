## Theorem
The [[fundamental group]] of the circle $S^1$ is $\mathbb Z$. ($\pi_1(S^1) = \mathbb Z$)
## Proof
We think of the circle as the [[group]] of all unit-[[norm]] complex numbers. Because [[matrix multiplication is smooth]], it forms a [[topological group]]. 

Use the [[identity element]] $1$ as the basepoint for calculations and recall that the fundamental group [[fundamental group does not depend on basepoint|is independent of the choice of basepoint]]. 

For all $n\in\mathbb N$, define a [[loop]] $f_n(s) = e^{2\pi i ns}$. Note that this is the composition of the map $s\mapsto e^{2\pi is}$ which sends the unit [[interval]] $I$ to $S^1$ and $z\mapsto z^n$ on $S^1$. If we identify the [[boundary]] points of $I$ with each other, then we get from the first map an identification of the [[quotient by equivalence relation|quotient]] space $I/\partial I$ with $S^1$.
