## Theorem
The [[p-adic integers]] $\mathbb Z_p$ are a [[unital subring]] of the [[p-adic field]] $\mathbb Q_p$. 
## Proof
Because the other properties are inherited nicely, we really only need to check closure. The [[non-Archimedean absolute value|ultrametric inequality]] gives us closure under addition very easily, and the multiplicative property of [[absolute value|absolute values]] give us closure under multiplication.
