## Theorem
The [[character of a representation|characters]] of the [[irreducible representation|irreducible]] [[group representation|representations]] of a finite [[group]] $G$ form an [[orthonormal]] [[basis]] for the [[vector space]] of [[class function|class functions]] on $G$ under the [[Hermitian inner product on class functions]].
