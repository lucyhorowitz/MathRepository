## Theorem
Suppose $f:Q\to \mathbb R$ is [[bounded]] on $Q$ a [[rectangle]] in $\mathbb R^n$. Then $f$ is [[Riemann integrable]] if and only if for all $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists a [[partition]] $P$ of $Q$ such that the [[lower sum|lower]] and [[upper sum|upper sums]] are within $\varepsilon$ of each other, i.e. $$U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \varepsilon.$$
