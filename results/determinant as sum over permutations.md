## Theorem
Let $A = (a_{ij})$ be an $n\times n$ [[matrix]]. Then the [[determinant]] may be written as the sum over all [[symmetric group|permutations]] $$\text{det}(A) = \sum_{\sigma\in S_n}\left( \text{sgn}(\sigma)\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i\sigma(i)}\right).$$ That is, the [[determinant]] may be written as a degree-$n$ [[polynomial]] in the entries of $A$.
