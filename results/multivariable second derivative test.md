## Theorem
Let $U\subset\mathbb R^n$ be an [[open]] subset and let $f:U\to\mathbb R$ be of [[class]] at least $C^2$. Let $a \in U$ be a [[critical point]] of $f$. If the [[Hessian matrix]] of $f$ at $a$ is [[positive definite]], then $a$ is a [[local minimum]]. If it is [[negative definite]], then $a$ is a [[local maximum]].
