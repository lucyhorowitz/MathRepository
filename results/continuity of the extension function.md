## Theorem
Let $S \subset\mathbb R^n$ be a [[bounded]] set and let $f:S \to \mathbb R$ be [[continuous]]. The [[extension of a function to R^n|extension]] $f_S:\mathbb R^n\to \mathbb R$ is [[continuous]] at some point $x_0\in \mathbb R^n$ if and only if either $x_0 \notin \partial S$ (the [[boundary]] of $S$) or if $\lim\limits_{x \to x_0} f(x) = 0$, where the limit is taken in $S$.
