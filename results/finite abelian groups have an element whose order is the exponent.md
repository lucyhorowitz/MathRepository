## Theorem
Let $A$ be a finite [[abelian]] [[group]]. Then there exists an element $a\in A$ such that the [[order of a group element|order]] of $a$ is equal to the [[exponent of a finite group|exponent]] of $A$.
## Proof
Let $A$ be an [[abelian]] [[group]] of [[order of a group]] $N$ and let $p_1^{k_1}\cdots p_r^{k_r}=N$ be the [[prime factorization is unique|prime factorization]] of $N$. Let $h_i$ be the [[order of a group element|order]] of an element $b_i$ in the $p_i$-[[p-primary component of an abelian group|primary component]] $A_{(p_i)}$ of $A$ and set $b= \sum_i b_i$. We first show that the [[order of a group element|order]] of $b$ is $\prod_i k_i$. 

Because $h_ib_i = 0$ for all $i$, it follows that $(h_1\cdots h_r)b=0$. #write_proof
