## Theorem
Let $L$ be a [[Lie algebra]] and $Z(L)$ its [[center of a Lie algebra|center]]. If the [[quotient of Lie algebra by ideal|quotient]] $L/Z(L)$ is [[nilpotent Lie algebra|nilpotent]], then so is $L$.
## Proof
Suppose that $L^n \subset Z(L)$, where $L^n$ is the $n$th term of the [[descending central series]] of $L$. Then $L^{n+1} = [L,L^n]\subset [LZ(L)]=0$.
