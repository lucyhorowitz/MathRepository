## Theorem
A [[cofibration]] is an inclusion with [[closed]] [[image]]. 
## Proof
A map $r$ that makes the diagram in the definition of [[mapping cylinder#A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology Concise version|mapping cylinder]] is such that $r\circ j = \text{id}$ where $j:Mi\to X\times I$ restricts to $i_0$ on $X$ and $\times \text{id}$ on $A\times I$. #write_proof
