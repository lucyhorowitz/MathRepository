## Theorem (for [[group|groups]])
Let $G$ be a non[[identity element|trivial]], finite [[group]]. Then "the" [[composition series]] for $G$ exists, and the composition factors are unique. That is, for two [[composition series]] $$\{e\}\subseteq N_1\subseteq \cdots\subseteq N_k \subseteq G$$ and $$\{e\}\subseteq M_1\subseteq \cdots\subseteq M_s \subseteq G$$ of $G$, $k=s$ and there exists a [[permutation]] $\sigma \in S_k$ such that the [[quotient by normal subgroup|quotients]] $N_{i+1}/N_i$ and $M_{\sigma(i)+1}/M_{\sigma)(i)}$ are [[group homomorphism|isomorphic]] for all $i$.

## Theorem (for [[ring|rings]])
Let $R$ be a [[ring]] and let $M$ be an $R$-[[module over a ring|module]]. Suppose that $F_0\supset \cdots F_n$ and $G_0\supset G_m$ are two [[composition series]] for $M$. Then $n=m$ and there exists $\sigma\in S_n$ the [[symmetric group]] on $n$ letters such that the following [[quotient of modules|quotients]] are [[module homomorphism|isomorphic]]: $F_i/F_{i+1} \cong G_{\sigma(i)}/G_{\sigma(i)+1}$.
