## Theorem
Let $f:X\to Y$ be a function between sets. There exists an [[injective]] map from the [[image]] $f(X)$ to $Y$ given by inclusion: denote this $i: f(X) \to Y$ by $f(x) \mapsto f(x)$. 
 
Let $\mathcal S$ be the collection of [[fiber|fibers]] of points in $X$. [[set of fibers is a partition of domain|Then]] $\mathcal S$ forms a [[partition]] of $X$. This partition induces a [[surjective|surjection]] $\pi_\mathcal S: X\to \mathcal S$ given by projection. 

Then there exists a [[bijective|bijection]] $b: \mathcal S \to f(X)$ such that the following [[commputative diagram|diagram commutes]]:

This is called a **factorization** of the function $f:X\to Y$.
