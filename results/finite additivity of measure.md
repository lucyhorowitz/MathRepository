## Theorem
Let $(X,\Sigma,\mu)$ be a [[measure space]]. For any finite disjoint collection $\{A_i\}_{i=1}^n$ of [[measurable]] sets in $\Sigma$, $$\mu\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\right) = \sum_{i=1}^n \mu(A_i).$$
## Proof
By definition, the [[measure space|measure]] $\mu$ is [[countable|countably]] additive. By setting $A_i = \emptyset$ so that $\mu(A_i)=0$ for all $i \geq n$, we have finite additivity. QED.
