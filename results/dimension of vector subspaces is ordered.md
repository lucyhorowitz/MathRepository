## Theorem
Let $W$ be a [[vector subspace|subspace]] of the [[vector space]] $V$. Then $\text{dim}(W) \leq \text{dim}(V)$ and if the [[dimension of vector space|dimension]] of $V$ is finite (say $\text{dim}(V) = n$) ,there exists a [[basis]] $\{v_i\}_{i=1}^n$ which has a subset that [[span|spans]] $W$, i.e.
$$W = \text{span}\{v_i\}_{i=1}^k$$ for $k = \text{dim}(W)$.
