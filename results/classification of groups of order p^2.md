## Theorem
Let $P$ be a [[group]] whose [[order of a group|order]] is $p^2$ for $p$ a prime number. Then $P$ is [[abelian]], and in particular, we have either $P = \mathbb Z/p^2\mathbb Z$ or $P = (\mathbb Z/p\mathbb Z)^2$. 
## Proof
#write_proof [[p-groups have nontrivial center]] [[group homomorphism]] [[cyclic group]] [[generating set of a group]] [[order of a group element]]
