## Theorem
Let $R$ be an [[integral domain]] and let $R[x]$ be the [[polynomial ring]] over $R$. For all $p,q \in R[x]$, the [[degree of polynomial|degree]] of the product of $p$ and $q$ is equal to the product of the [[degree of polynomial|degrees]] of $p$ and $q$. Morevoer,
- $R[x]$ is itself an [[integral domain]];
- The [[unit of a ring|units]] of $R[x]$ are precisely the [[unit of a ring|units]] of $R$ when considered as a [[unital subring|subring]].
