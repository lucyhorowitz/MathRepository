## Theorem
Let $G$ be a finite [[group]] of [[order of a group|order]] $p^aq^b$ for $p,q$ [[prime number|primes]] and $a,b$ nonnegative integers. Then $G$ is [[solvable group|solvable]]. 

Consequently, every non-[[abelian]] finite [[simple group|simple]] [[group]] has [[order of a group|order]] [[division in a ring|divisible]] by at least three [[prime number|primes]].
