## Theorem
Let $(X,\Sigma,\mu)$ and $(Y,T,\nu)$  be [[measure space|measure spaces]] and let $T: L_1(X,\mu) \to L_1(Y,\nu)$ be a subadditive (i.e., such that $|T(f+g)(x)| \leq |Tf(x)| + |Tg(x)|$) operator that maps [[measurable function|measurable functions]] on $X$ to measurable functions on $Y$.  Suppose that $T$ is of type [[weak (p,q)|weak]] $(p_1,q_1)$ and of type [[weak (p,q)|weak]] $(p_2,q_2)$ for $1\leq p_i\leq q_i\leq\infty$ with $q_1\neq q_2$. Then $T$ is also of type [[strong (p,q)|strong]] $(p_t,q_t)$ where $$\frac{1}{p_t} = \frac{1-t}{p_1} +\frac{t}{p_2} \text{ and } \frac{1}{q_t} = \frac{1-t}{q_1} + \frac{t}{q_2}$$ for $0 < t < 1$.
