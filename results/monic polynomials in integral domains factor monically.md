## Theorem
Let $f$ be a [[monic]] [[polynomial ring|polynomial]] over an [[integral domain]] $R$. Then if $f$ is not [[irreducible element of an integral domain|irreducible]] (i.e. if it is reducible), then $f=gh$ where $g$ and $h$ are both [[monic]] [[polynomial ring|polynomials]] of strictly smaller [[degree of polynomial|degree]].
