## Theorem
Let $X$ be a [[CW complex]] such that no two consecutive dimensions contain $n$-cells. Then the $n$th [[homology group]] $H_n(X)$ is [[free group|free]] [[abelian]] with [[basis for abelian group|basis]] in [[bijective|bijection]] with the $n$-cells of $X$.
## Proof
#write_proof [[cellular chain complex]] [[cellular homology groups]] [[cellular homology groups are isomorphic to homology groups]]
