## Theorem
Let $A \subset \mathbb R^n$ be [[open]] and let $f: A \to \mathbb R^n$ be of [[class]] $C^k$. If $Df(x)$ is invertible at the point $a \in A$, then there is a neighborhood $U$ of $a$ such that $f:U \to V$ is [[bijective]] where $V$ is some [[open]] subset of $\mathbb R^n$ and its inverse is also of [[class]] $C^k$.
