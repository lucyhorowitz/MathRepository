## Theorem
Let $\mathcal B$ be a [[groupoid]] and let $p:\mathcal E\to\mathcal B$ and $p':\mathcal E'\to \mathcal B$ be [[covering of groupoids|coverings]] of $\mathcal B$. Choose base objects $b\in \mathcal B$, $e\in \mathcal E$, and $e\in\mathcal E'$ such that $p(e) = b = p'(e')$. Then there exists a [[map of covering of groupoid|map]] $g:\mathcal E\to\mathcal E'$ with $g(e)=e'$ if and only if $$p(\pi(\mathcal E,e)) \subseteq p'(\pi(\mathcal E',e'))$$ and if $g$ exists, it is unique. 

In particular, two [[map of covering of groupoid|maps]] of covers $g,g;:\mathcal E\to\mathcal E'$ coincide if $g(e) = g'(e)$ for any one object $e\in E$. Moreover, $g$ is an [[isomorphism of categories|isomorphism]] if and only if equality holds in $p(\pi(\mathcal E,e)) \subseteq p'(\pi(\mathcal E',e'))$.Therefore $\mathcal E$ and $\mathcal E'$ are [[isomorphism of categories|isomorphic]] if and only if $p(\pi(\mathcal E,e))$ and $p'(\pi(\mathcal E',e'))$  are [[conjugate subgroups|conjugate]] whenever $p(e) = p'(e')$.

## Theorem (in terms of [[fiber|fibers]])
Let $p:\mathcal E\to \mathcal B$ and $p':\mathcal E'\to \mathcal B$ be [[covering of groupoids|coverings]] of $\mathcal B$. Choose a base object $b\in \mathcal B$ and let $G = \pi(\mathcal B,b)$ as defined in the [[star of an object|star]]. If $g:\mathcal E\to\mathcal E$ is a [[map of covering of groupoid|map of coverings]], then on the [[fiber]], $g$ restricts to a map $F_b\to F_b'$ of [[group action|G-sets]] and this restriction specifies a [[bijective|bijection]] between the [[category of coverings of groupoids]] and the set of [[equivariant map|G-maps]] $F_b\to F_b'$.
## Proof
Let $e\in F_b$ and $f\in\pi(\mathcal B,b)$. By definition, $fe$ is the target of the map $\tilde f\in \text{St}_\mathcal E(e)$ such that $p(\tilde f) = f$ Clearly $g(fe)$ is the target of $g(\tilde f) \in \text{St}_{\mathcal E'}(g(e))$  and $p'(g(\tilde f)) = p(\tilde f) = f$. Again by definition, $g(fe) = fg(e)$. Then the first statement of this theorem tells us that restriction to [[fiber|fibers]] gives an [[injective|injection]] on the[[category of coverings of groupoids]] $\text{Cov}(\mathcal E,\mathcal E')$. To show [[surjective|surjectivity]], let $\alpha:F_b\to F_{b}'$ be a [[equivariant map|G-map]]. Choose $e\in F_b$ and let $e'=\alpha(e)$. Since $\alpha$ is a [[equivariant map|G-map]], the [[stabilizer under group action|isotropy subgroup]] $p(\pi(\mathcal E,e))$ of $e$ is contained in the [[stabilizer under group action|isotropy subgroup]] $p'(\pi(\mathcal E',e'))$ of $e'$. Thus the first statement of the theorem ensures the existence of a [[map of covering of groupoid|covering map]] $g$ that restricts to $\alpha$ on [[fiber|fibers]].
