## Theorem
Let $T:V\to V$ be a [[bounded function|bounded]] [[linear transformation]] from the [[vector space]] $V$ to itself. Then $V$ may be written as the [[direct sum of vector spaces|direct sum]] $$V =\text{im}(T) \oplus \text{ker}(T^*)$$ of the [[image]] of $T$ and the [[kernel of linear transformation|kernel]] of the [[adjoint of a linear transformation|adjoint]] of $T$.
## Proof
#write_proof [[image of a linear transformation is orthogonal complement of kernel of its adjoint]]
