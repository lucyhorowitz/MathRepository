## Theorem
Let $G$ be a [[group]] [[group action|acting]] on the right and on the left of a set $X$, possibly in two different ways. I.e. let $G$ be a group together with two functions, $L:G\times X\to X$ and $R:G\times X \to X$ where $L_g(x) = gx$ and $R_g(x) = xg^{-1}$, and where perhaps $gx \neq xg^{-1}$. Then $L$ and $R$ commute. 

## Proof
This follows immediately from simple computation.
