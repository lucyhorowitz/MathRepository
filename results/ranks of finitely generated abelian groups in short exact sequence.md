## Theorem
Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be finitely [[generating set of a group|generated]] [[abelian]] [[group|groups]] that fit into the [[short exact sequence]] $$0\to A\to B\to C.$$ Then the [[rank of a finitely generated abelian group|ranks]] of $A$, $B$, and $C$ satisfy $$\text{rank}(B) = \text{rank}(A) + \text{rank}(C).$$
