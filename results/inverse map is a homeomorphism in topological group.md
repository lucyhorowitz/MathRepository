## Theorem
Let $G$ be a [[topological group]]. Then the [[inverse element|inverse]] map $\text{inv}:G\to G$ given by $g\mapsto g^{-1}$ is a [[homeomorphism]].

## Proof
By definition of [[topological group]], $\text{inv}$ is [[continuous]]. Moreover, it is its own [[inverse function]], and since the inverse function exists it must be a [[bijective|bijection]], continuous in both directions.
