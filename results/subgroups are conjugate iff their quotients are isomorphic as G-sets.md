## Theorem
Let $G$ be a [[group]] with two [[subgroup|subgroups]] $H_1$ and $H_2$. Then $H_1$ and $H_2$ are [[conjugate subgroups|conjugate]] to each other if and only if their [[quotient by subgroup|quotients]] $G/H_1$ and $G/H_2$ are [[equivariant map|isomorphic]] as [[group action|G-sets]].
## Proof
#write_proof The [[group]] $G$ [[action of a group on quotient by subgroup|acts on]] both $G/H_1$ and $G/H_2$.
