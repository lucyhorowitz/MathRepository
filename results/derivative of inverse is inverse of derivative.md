## Theorem
Let $U \subset \mathbb R^n$ be [[open]] and let $f:U\to\mathbb R^n$. Let $f(a)=b$ and suppose that $g$ maps some neighborhood $V$ of $b$ into $\mathbb R^n$, that $g(b) = a$, and that $g(f(x))=x$ for all $x\in V$. If $f$ is [[differentiable]] at $a$ and $g$ is [[differentiable]] at $b$, then $$Dg(b) = (Df(a))^{-1}.$$
