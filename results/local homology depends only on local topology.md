## Theorem
Let $X$ be a [[topological space]]. Then for any [[neighborhood]] $U$ of a point $x\in X$, the [[local homology groups]] $H_n(X,X\setminus \{x\})$ are [[group homomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[relative homology groups]] $H_n(U,U\setminus \{x\})$, so they only depend on the local topology of $X$ near $x$.
## Proof
The [[group homomorphism|isomorphism]] follows from the [[Excision Theorem]]. 

Note that because [[continuous functions induce homomorphisms on homology groups]] and therefore [[homeomorphism|homeomorphisms]] induce [[isomorphism|isomorphisms]], we can tell when certain spaces are not locally [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] at certain points.
