## Theorem
[[curly P|Curly P]] is [[compact]] as a [[subspace topology|subspace]] of the [[p-adic field]] under the $p$-adic [[absolute value induces a topology|absolute value topology]].

Moreover, every [[left coset|coset]] of $\mathcal P$ and every power of $\mathcal P$ is also [[compact]].
## Proof 
$\mathcal P$ is a [[closed]] [[subspace topology|subspace]] of the [[p-adic integers]], which [[p-adic integers are compact|is]] [[compact]] as a [[subspace topology|subspace]] of $\mathbb Q_p$. [[closed subsets of compact sets are compact|Then]] $\mathcal P$ is [[compact]].
