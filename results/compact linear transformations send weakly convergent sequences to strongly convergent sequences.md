## Theorem
Let $H$ be a [[Hilbert space]]. Then a [[linear transformation]] $T:H\to H$ is [[compact linear transformation|compact]] if and only if for $\{x_n\}_{n\in\mathbb N}$ a [[weak convergence|weakly convergent]] sequence, $\{T(x_n)\}_{n\in\mathbb N}$ is a [[sequence convergence|strongly convergent]] sequence.
## Proof
#write_proof [[adjoint of a linear transformation]] [[linear transformation is compact if and only if image of bounded sequence has strongly convergent subsequence]]
