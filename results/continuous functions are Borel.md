## Theorem
A [[continuous]] function $f:X\to \mathbb R$ on the [[Borel space]] $(X,B)$ is [[Borel function|Borel-measurable]].
## Proof
Let $f:X\to \mathbb R$ be [[continuous]]. By definition, the [[preimage]] of every [[open]] set is [[open]]. Since the [[Borel σ-algebra|open sets generate the Borel σ-algebra]], and from the[[generating condition for function measurability]], it must be that $f$ is [[Borel function|Borel-measurable]].
