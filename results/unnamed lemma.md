## Theorem
Let $f:G\to H$ be a [[group homomorphism]] where $N$ is a [[normal subgroup]] of $G$. Then the following statements are equivalent:
1. $N$ is a [[subgroup]] of the [[kernel of group homomorphism|kernel]] of $f$;
2. the [[image]] of $N$ is the [[identity element|trivial]] [[group]];
3. there exists a [[group homomorphism]] $\overline f$ such that $\overline f\circ\pi = f$ where $\pi$ is the projection from $G$ to the [[quotient by normal subgroup|quotient group]] $G/N$. 

## Proof
The fact that (1) if and only if (2) is clear. #write_proof
