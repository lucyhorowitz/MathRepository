## Theorem
Let $G,H$ be [[group|groups]] and $f:G\to H$ a [[group homomorphism]]. Then the [[image]] $f(G) \subset H$ is a [[subgroup]] of $H$.
## Proof
- Let $f(g_1),f(g_2)\in f(G)$. Then $f(g_1)f(g_2) = f(g_1g_2) \in f(G)$ by properties of the [[group homomorphism]]. Thus $f(G)$ is closed under the group operation.
- By properties of the [[group homomorphism]], $f(e_G) = e_H$ so the [[identity element]] of $H$ is in $f(G)$.
- Let $f(g) \in f(G)$. Then $f(g)^{-1} = f(g^{-1})\in f(G)$ by INSERT THEOREM HERE so that the inverse of every element of $f(G)$ is also in $f(G)$. 

Thus $f(G)$ is a [[subgroup]] of $H$.
