## Theorem
Let $p:D\to B$ and $q:E\to B$ be [[fibration|fibrations]] and let $f:D\to E$ be a [[continuous]] function such that $q\circ f=p$. Suppose that $f$ is a [[homotopy equivalence of spaces|homotopy equivalence]]. Then $f$ is a [[category of spaces over B|fiber homotopy equivalence]].
## Proof
The proof is exactly dual to [[existence of cofiber homotopy equivalence]].
