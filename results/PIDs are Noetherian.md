## Theorem
Let $R$ be a [[principal ideal domain]]. Then $R$ is [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]].
## Proof
Every nonempty collection of [[ring ideal|ideals]] of $R$ has a maximal element under inclusion, so $R$ when considered as a [[module over a ring|module]] over itself is [[Noetherian module]] by the [[equivalent conditions to Noetherian]].
