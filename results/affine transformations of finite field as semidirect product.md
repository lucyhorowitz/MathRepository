## Theorem
Let $A$ be an [[elementary abelian p-group]] [[classification of finite elementary abelian p-groups|of]] [[order of a group|order]] $p^n$. Then the [[semidirect product]] of $A$ with the [[automorphism group]] $A$ via the [[identity function]] (that is, $A\rtimes_\text{id} \text{Aut}(A)$) is equal to the [[affine transformations]] of the $n$-fold Cartesian product of the finite [[field]] of $p$ elements: $$A\rtimes_\text{id} \text{Aut}(A) = \text{Aff}(\mathbb F_p^n).$$
