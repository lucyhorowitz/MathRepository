## Theorem
Let $E$ and $B$ be [[connected]], [[locally path-connected]] [[topological space|topological spaces]] such that the [[covering space]] $p:E\to B$ is [[universal covering space|universal]]. If it exists, this cover is unique up to [[map of coverings of a space|isomorphism]] and [[map of coverings of a space is a covering|covers]] any other [[covering space|cover]].
## Proof
[[existence of map of covering spaces]]
