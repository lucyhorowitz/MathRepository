The **special [[complex orthogonal group]]** is the [[group]] of $n\times n$ matrices in the [[complex orthogonal group]] whose [[determinant]] is $1$. 

This [[group]] is a [[matrix Lie group]] because it is a [[subgroup]] of the [[general linear group]] $\text{GL}(n,\mathbb C)$.

### Proof that it is a [[group]]
