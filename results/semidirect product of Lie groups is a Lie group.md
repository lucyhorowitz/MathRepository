## Theorem
Let $L$ and $H$ be [[Lie group|Lie groups]]. Their [[semidirect product]] $L\ltimes H$ is also a [[Lie group]].
## Proof
The Cartesian product of the two [[definitions/manifold|manifolds]] $L$ and $H$ [[product of manifolds is a manifold|is a manifold]]. Moreover, the requirement that the operations on a [[Lie group]] be [[smooth]] guarantees by definition of the [[semidirect product]] and the fact that [[composition preserves class]] that $L\ltimes H$ is a [[Lie group]].
