## Theorem
Let $G$ be a finite [[group]] and let $(V,\rho)$ be a complex [[group representation|representation]] of $G$. Then there exists a  unique finite set of distinct [[irreducible representation|irreducible representations]] $V_1,\dots,V_n$ with respective multiplicities $m_1,\dots,m_n$ such that $$V \cong V_1^{\oplus m_1} \oplus\cdots \oplus V_n^{\oplus m_n}.$$ That is, $V$ is [[isomorphism of group representations|isomorphic]] to the [[direct sum of group representations|direct sum]] of $m_i$ copies of each $V_i$.
