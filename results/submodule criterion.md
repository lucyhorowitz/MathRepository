## Theorem
Let $R$ be a [[ring]] and let $M$ be an $R$-[[module over a ring|module]]. A subset $N$ of $M$ is a [[submodule]] if and only if $N$ is not empty and $x+ay\in N$ for all $a\in R$ and all $x,y\in N$. 
## Proof
This follows form a simple application of the [[subgroup criterion]] to the [[group]] that underlies $M$ and $N$.
