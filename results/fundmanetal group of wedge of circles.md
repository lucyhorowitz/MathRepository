## Theorem
The [[fundamental group]] of a [[wedge sum]] of circles ($S^1$) is a [[free group]] with one [[generating set of a group|generator]] for each circle.
## Proof
This follows immediately from this: [[fundamental group of wedge product of path-connected based spaces with contractible basepoint neighborhoods]].
