## Theorem
For any [[compact]], [[oriented manifold|oriented]] [[embedded m-dimensional manifold with boundary]], there exists a [[smooth]] map $X: \partial M \to \mathbb R^n$ such that for all $p \in \partial M$,
1. $X(p)\in T_pM$ the [[tangent space]] of $M$ at $p$.
2. $X(p)$ is [[outward pointing]].
