## Theorem
The [[degree of map between spheres|degree]] of a [[continuous]] function $f:S^n\to S^n$ is $\pm 1$ if and only if $f$ is a [[homotopy equivalence of spaces]]. 
## Proof
If the product $fg$ is [[homotopy equivalence of spaces|homotopy equivalent]] to the [[identity function]], then the [[degree of composition of maps between spheres is product of degree of maps|degree of the composition]] [[degree of identity map on sphere|is]] $\text{deg}(fg) = \text{deg}(f)\text{deg}(g) = \text{deg}(\mathbb 1) = 1$.
