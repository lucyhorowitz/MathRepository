## Theorem
Let $B$ be a [[connected]], [[locally path-connected]] [[topological space]]. Chose a basepoint $b\in B$ and let $G$ be the [[fundamental group]] $\pi_1(B,b)$ of $B$ based at $b$. Then there exists a [[functor]] $$E(-):\mathcal O(G) \to \text{Cov}(B)$$ that is an [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]] of the [[category of canonical orbits]] and the [[category of covering spaces]]. For each [[subgroup]] $H$ of $G$, the [[covering space|covering]] $p:E(G/H)\to B$ has a canonical basepoint $e$ in its [[fiber]] over $b$ such that the [[image]] of the [[continuous functions induce homomorphisms on homology groups|induced homomorphism]] $$p_*(\pi_1(E(G/H),e)) = H.$$ Moreover, the [[covering space|fundamental neighborhood]] $F_b$ is [[equivariant map|G-isomorphic]] to the [[quotient by subgroup|quotient]] of $G$ by $H$ as [[group action|G-sets]] and for a [[equivariant map|G-map]] $\alpha:G/H\to G/K$ in $\mathcal O(G)$,  the restriction of $E(\alpha):E(G/H)\to E(G/K)$ to [[fiber|fibers]] over $b$ coincides with $\alpha$.
