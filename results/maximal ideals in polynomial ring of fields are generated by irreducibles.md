## Theorem
Let $F$ be a [[field]] and $F[x]$ its [[polynomial ring|polynomial]]. Then the [[maximal ring ideal|maximal]] [[ring ideal|ideals]] of $F[x]$ are [[generate a ring ideal|generated]] by [[irreducible element of an integral domain|irreducible]] polynomials. 

That is, the [[quotient ring]] $F[x]/(f(x))$ is a [[field]] if and only if $f$ is [[irreducible element of an integral domain|irreducible]].
## Proof
We [[properties of polynomial ring of integral domain|know]] that $F[x]$ is a [[principal ideal domain]], so we can apply the fact that [[prime ideals in PIDs are maximal]], and finally that a [[commutative ring ideal is maximal iff quotient is a field]].
