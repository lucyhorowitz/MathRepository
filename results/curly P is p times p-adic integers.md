## Theorem
[[curly P|Curly P]] is the [[ring ideal|ideal]] of the [[p-adic integers]] [[generate a ring ideal|generated by]] multiples of $p$. That is, $\mathcal P = p\mathbb Z_p$. 

## Proof
For $z\in\mathbb Z_p$ note that the [[p-adic field|p-adic]] [[absolute value]] of $z$ is less than or equal to $1$. Then $|pz|_p=p^{-1}|z|_p < 1$, and the inequality is strict, so $pz\in \mathcal P$ as desired. Now let $x\in \mathcal P$.  Then $|x|_p < 1$, so $\left|\frac{x}{p}\right|_p = p|x|_p < p$, again strictly. In particular, because we have a [[discrete valuation|discrete]] [[absolute value]], $|x/p|_p \leq 1$. If we write $z=x/p$, then $x=zp$ so that $x\in p\mathbb Z_p$.
