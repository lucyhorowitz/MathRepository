## Theorem
Let $X$ be a [[connected graph|connected]] [[graph]]. Then its [[fundamental group]] $\pi_1(X)$ is a [[free group]] with one [[generating set of a group|generator]] for each edge not in a given [[maximal subtree]]. If $X$ is finite, then $\pi_1(X)$ is free on $1-\chi(X)$ generators; in particular $\chi(X) \leq 1$ with equality if and only if $X$ is a [[tree]]. 
## Proof
[[Euler characteristic of a tree is 1]] [[Euler characteristic]] [[Euler characteristic of a graph]]  [[homotopy types of graphs]]
