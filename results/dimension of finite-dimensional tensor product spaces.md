## Theorem
The [[dimension of vector space]] of the [[tensor product of vector spaces|tensor product]] of [[definitions/vector space|vector spaces]] $V$ and $W$ is $$\text{dim}(V\otimes W) = \text{dim}(V) \text{dim}(W).$$
## Proof
#write_proof  [[basis for finite-dimensional tensor product of vector spaces]]
