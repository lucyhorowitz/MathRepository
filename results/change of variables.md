## Theorem (MATH 20800 version)
Let $U,V\subset\mathbb R^n$ be [[open]] sets and let $g: U\to V$ be a $C^k$ [[diffeomorphism]]. Let $S \subset\mathbb R^n$ be a [[rectifiable]] whose [[closure]] is contained in $V$ (i.e. $\overline S \subset V$). Let $f:S\to\mathbb R$ be an [[Riemann integrable]] function on $S$. Then $$\int_S f= \int_T(f\circ g)Jg$$ where $T = g^{-1}(S)$ and $Jg$ is the [[Jacobian determinant]] of $g$.
