## Theorem
Let $U \subset \mathbb R^n$ and $V \subset \mathbb R^m$ be [[open|open]]. Let $f: U\to\mathbb R^m$ be [[differentiable]] at $a \in U$ and let $g: V \to \mathbb R^k$ be [[differentiable]] at $b=f(a) \in V$. Then the composite function $g\circ f: U \to \mathbb R^k$ is also [[differentiable]] at $a$ and has [[differentiable|derivative]] $$D(g\circ f)(a) = Dg(b) \circ Df(a).$$
