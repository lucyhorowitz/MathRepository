## Theorem
If $I$ and $J$ are two [[solvable Lie algebra|solvable]] [[ideal of a Lie algebra|ideals]] of the [[Lie algebra]] $L$, then $I+J$ is also a [[solvable Lie algebra|solvable]] [[ideal of a Lie algebra|ideal]] of $L$.
## Proof
There [[quotient of sum of ideals is isomorphic to quotient of ideal by intersection of ideals|exists]] an [[Lie algebra homomorphism|isomorphism]] between $(I+J)/J$ and $I/(I\cap J)$. The [[quotient of Lie algebra by ideal|quotient]] $I/(I\cap J)$ is a [[Lie algebra homomorphism|homomorphic]] [[image]] of $I$ by a [[definitions/canonical map]] $\pi: I \to I/(I\cap J)$, [[all homomorphic images of a solavble Lie algebra are solvable|so]] it is [[solvable Lie algebra|solvable]]. Then because $(I+J)/J$ and $I/(I\cap J)$ are [[Lie algebra homomorphism|isomorphic]], $(I+J)/J$ is also [[solvable Lie algebra|solvable]]. [[solvable ideal with solvable quotient implies parent Lie algebra is solvable|Then]] $I+J$ is [[solvable Lie algebra|solvable]].
