## Theorem
Let $x\in Q$. Then the product of [[Ostrowski's theorem|all]] [[absolute value|absolute values]] of $x$ is equal to $1$. That is, $$\left(\prod_{p\text{ prime}} |x|_p\right)|x|_\infty = 1.$$

## Proof
This follows directly from the [[Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic]]: we are essentially writing the numerator and denominator of $p$ as products of [[prime number|primes]] with the usual absolute value, and then canceling each one out with the inverse of the power of the prime contained within.
