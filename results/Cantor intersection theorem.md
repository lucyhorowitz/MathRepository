## Theorem
Let $X$ be a [[metric space]]. Then $X$ is [[complete metric space|complete]] if and only if for every [[contracting sequence of sets in a metric space|contracting sequence]] $\{F_n\}_{n\in\mathbb N}$ of sets nonempty, [[closed]] subsets, there is a point $x\in X$ for which $\bigcap\limits_{n\in\mathbb N} F_n = x.$
