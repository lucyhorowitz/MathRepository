## Theorem
There is a natural inclusion of $\mathbb Z$ into the [[p-adic integers]] $\mathbb Z_p$ given by $e:\mathbb Z\to \mathbb Z_p$ where $$e(x) = \begin{cases}\underbrace{1+\cdots + 1}_{n\text{ times}} & x= n> 0 \\-\left(\underbrace{1+\cdots + 1}_{n\text{ times}}\right) & x= n< 0 \\
0 & x=0.
\end{cases}$$ Note that this is the canonical map that makes $\mathbb Z$ [[Z is the initial ring|the]] [[initial object|initial]] [[ring]]. The [[image]] of this map is [[dense]] in $\mathbb Z_p$. 

## Proof
We know that $e$ does in fact map to the [[p-adic integers]] rather than just the [[p-adic field]] $\mathbb Q_p$ because the [[p-adic field|p-adic]] [[absolute value]] is [[non-Archimedean absolute value|non-Archimedean]] and because an [[absolute value on F is non-Archimedean iff image of Z is less than 1]], and this is just how we define the [[p-adic integers]]. We need to show that for all $x\in\mathbb Z_p$, for any $n\in \mathbb N$, there exists $\alpha\in\mathbb Z$  such that $|x-\alpha|_p \leq p^{-n}$. Let $x= \frac{a}{b}$ such that $a$ and $b$ are [[coprime]] and fix $n\in\mathbb N$. Then if $x\in \mathbb Z_p$, then $|x|_p \leq 1$ so $p$ does not [[division in a ring|divide]] $b$. But then neither does $p^n$, so we have that the [[greatest common divisor]] of $p^n$ and $b$ is $1$. Then by [[Bezout's identity]], there exist $c,d\in\mathbb Z$ such that $cb+dp^n =1$. We can find such $c$ and $d$ via the [[Euclidean algorithm]]. Let $\alpha = ac$. Then $$\begin{align*}|\alpha-x|_p&= \left|ac - \frac{a}{b}\right|_p\\ &= \left|\frac{a}{b}\right|_p\cdot|cb-1|_p\leq p^{-n}.\end{align*}$$ Moreover, it is possible to choose $\alpha \in\{0,1,\dots, p^{n}-1\}$. Given $\alpha$ as above, we can find $k\in\mathbb Z$ scuh that $0\leq \alpha+kp^n\leq p^n$ and set $\alpha'=\alpha +kp^n$. #write_proof  INCLUDE HW THING
