## Theorem
Let $X$ and $Y$ be [[topological space|topological spaces]] and let the elements [[chain complex]] of [[n-chain|n-chains]] of each of these be denoted $C_n(X)$ and $C_n(Y)$. Then a [[chain map]] $f_\sharp$ between these two [[chain complex|chain complexes]] induces [[group homomorphism|homomorphisms]] $f_*:H_n(X)\to H_n(Y)$ between the [[homology group|homology groups]] of the [[chain complex|chain complexes.]]
