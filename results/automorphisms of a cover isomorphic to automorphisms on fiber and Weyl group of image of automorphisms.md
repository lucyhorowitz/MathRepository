## Theorem
Let $E$ and $B$ be [[connected]], [[locally path-connected]] [[topological space|topological spaces]] and let $p:E\to B$ be a [[covering space|covering]] of $B$. Choose $b\in B$ and $e\in F_b$ the [[fiber]] over $b$. Let $G$ be the [[fundamental group]] of $B$ based at $b$ and let $H$ be the image of the [[fundamental group]] of $E$ based at $e$ under the [[continuous functions induce homomorphisms on homology groups|homomorphism induced]] by $p$. That is, let $G=\pi_1(B,b)$ and $H =p_*(\pi_1(E,e))$. Then the [[automorphism group of coverings|automorphism group]] of the [[covering space]] $E$ is [[group homomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[group]] of [[equivariant map|G-isomorphisms]] of the [[fiber]] $F_b$ as a [[group action|G-set]] and therefore tho the [[Weyl group]] $WH$. If $p$ is [[regular covering space|regular]], then $\text{Aut}(E)$ is [[group homomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[quotient by subgroup|quotient]] $G/H$. If $p$ is [[universal covering space|universal]], then  $\text{Aut}(E)\cong G$.
