## Theorem
Let $Q\subset\mathbb R^n$ be a [[rectangle]] and let 
$f:Q\to\mathbb R$ be a nonnegative [[bounded]] [[Riemann integrable]] function. Let $$S = \{(x,t) \mid x\in Q, 0\leq t\leq f(x)\}$$ be the region under the [[graph of a function|graph]] of $f$. Then $S$ is [[rectifiable]] and has  [[volume of a rectifiable set|volume]] $$\text{vol}(S) = \int_S f.$$
## Proof
