## Theorem
Let $f:[a,b] \to \mathbb R$ be [[continuous]]. If $f(a)<x<f(b)$, then there exists $c \in (a,b)$ such that $f(c) = x$.
## Proof
- $[a,b]$ is [[connected]]:
	- $[a,b]$ is an [[interval]].
	- [[connected subsets of R|Intervals are connected]].
- $f([a,b])\subset \mathbb R$ is [[connected]]:
	- $f$ is [[continuous]].
	- [[continuous functions preserve connectedness]].
- $f([a,b])$ is an [[interval]]:
	- [[connected subsets of R|Connected subsets of R are intervals.]]
- $x\in f([a,b])$:
	- $f(a)<x<f(b)$, and $[f(a), f(b)]$ is an [[interval]].
- There exists $c \in (a,b)$ such that $f(c) = x$.
