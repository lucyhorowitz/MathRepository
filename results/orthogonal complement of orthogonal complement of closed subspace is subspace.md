## Theorem
Let $W$ be a [[closed]] [[vector subspace]] of the [[Hilbert space]] $H$. Then the [[orthogonal complement]] of the [[orthogonal complement]] of $W$ is equal to $W$. That is, $$W = (W^\perp)^\perp.$$
## Proof
#write_proof [[Hilbert space is direct sum of closed subspace and its orthogonal complement]]
