## Theorem
If $f:S^n\to S^n$ is a [[continuous]] function that is not [[surjective]], then its [[degree of map between spheres|degree]] is zero.
## Proof
Choose a point $x_0 \in S^n \setminus f(S^n)$. Then $f$ can be [[factorization of functions|factorized]] as a composition $S^n\to S^n\setminus \{x_0\} \hookrightarrow S^n$. Moreover, the [[homology group]] $H_n(S^n\setminus \{x_0\})$ is zero because $S^n\setminus \{x_0\}$ is [[contractible]]. Thus the [[continuous functions induce homomorphisms on homology groups|induced homomorphism]] is trivial.
