## Theorem
Let $f:G\to H$ be a [[group homomorphism|homomorphism]] of finite [[group|groups]]. Then the [[order of a group|order]] of the [[image]] $f(G)$ divides the [[order of a group|order]] of both $G$ and $H$. (Consequently, it divides their [[greatest common denominator|gcd]].)
## Proof
[[Lagrange's theorem]]
