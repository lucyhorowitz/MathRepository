where $B$ is a [[connected]], [[locally path-connected]] [[topological space]], $\Pi(B)$ is its [[fundamental groupoid]], $\pi_1(B,b)$ is its [[fundamental group]] based at $b$, $\mathcal O(\pi_1(B,b))$ is the [[category of canonical orbits]] of $\pi_1(B,b))$, $\text{Cov}(B)$ is the [[category of covering spaces]] of $B$,  $\text{Cov}(\Pi(B))$ is the [[category of coverings of groupoids]] of $\Pi(B)$, $E(-)$ is the [[equivalence of categories between canonical orbits and coverings of a space]], $\mathcal E(-)$ is the [[equivalence of categories between canonical orbits and coverings of a groupoid]], and $\Pi$ is the [[groupoid]] [[functor]].
