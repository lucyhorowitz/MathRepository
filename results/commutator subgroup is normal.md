## Theorem
Let $G$ be a [[group]]. Then its [[commutator subgroup]] $[G,G]$ is [[normal subgroup|normal]] in $G$.
## Proof
Any $a\in G$ gives rise to the [[inner automorphism of a group|inner autormorphism]] $\phi_a:G\to G$. Because the [[image of commutator subgroup is contained in commutator subgroup of codomain]], $\phi_a[G,G]\subset [G,G]$, and thus $[G,G]$ is normal.
## Proof (2)
[[commutator subgroup is characteristic]] and [[characteristic implies normal]].
