## Theorem
Let $G$ be a [[group]] with [[normal subgroup]] $N$. Then the [[order of a group|order]] of the [[quotient by normal subgroup|quotient]] $G/N$ divides the [[order of a group|order]] of $G$.
## Proof
The [[quotient by normal subgroup|quotient]] is a [[subgroup]] of $G$ and therefore we can apply [[Lagrange's theorem]] to get the result.
