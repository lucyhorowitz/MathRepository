## Theorem
Let $G$ be a finite [[group]]. Then the [[center of an algebra|center]] of the [[group algebra]] $\mathbb C[G]$ is [[algebra homomorphism|isomorphic]] to a [[direct sum of algebras|direct sum]] of $\mathbb C$s.
## Proof
#write_proof  [[center of group algebra over C has basis indexed by conjugacy classes]]
