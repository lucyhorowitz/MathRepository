## Theorem
Let $G$ be a finite [[group]] and let $V$ be an [[irreducible representation|irreducible]] [[group representation|representation]] of $G$ with [[character of a representation|character]] $\chi$. Then the [[dimension of group representation|dimension]] of $\chi$ [[division in a ring|divides]] the [[order of a group|order]] of $G$.

## Proof
Because both $d_\chi$ and $|G|$ must necessarily be natural numbers, we know that $\frac{d_\chi}{|G|} \in \mathbb Q$. Moreover, $d_\chi$ is an [[algebraic integer]] because the algebraic integers form a [[ring]]. It follows that $\frac{d_\chi}{|G|}$ is an integer because the [[intersection of algebraic integers and rational numbers is integers]].
