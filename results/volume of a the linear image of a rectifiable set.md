## Theorem
Let $S\subset\mathbb R^n$ be a [[rectifiable]] set and let $G: \mathbb R^n \to\mathbb R^n$ be an [[bijective|invertible]] linear map. Then the [[volume of a rectifiable set|volume]] of the image of $G$ scales by the [[determinant]] with the [[volume of a rectifiable set|volume]] of $S$. That is, $$\text{vol}(G(S))= |\text{det}(G)|\text{vol}(S).$$
