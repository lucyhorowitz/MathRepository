## Theorem
Let $V,U$ be [[definitions/vector space|vector spaces]] and let $W\subset V$ be a [[vector subspace]]. There exists an [[linear transformation|isomorphism]] between $\text{Maps}(V/W, U)$ and the [[vector subspace]] of $\text{Maps}(V,U)$ consisting of [[linear transformation|linear transformations]] such that $T(w) = 0$ for all $w \in W$.
