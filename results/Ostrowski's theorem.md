## Theorem
Every nontrivial [[absolute value]] on $\mathbb Q$ is either [[equivalent absolute values|equivalent]] to the usual absolute value or to a [[p-adic field|p-adic]] absolute value. 
## Proof (sort of)
Let $x\in \mathbb Q$ such that $x=p^n\cdot\frac{a}{b} = q^n\cdot \frac{c}{d}$ where $n\neq m$. We can always find such $x$ by the [[Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic]]. Then $|x|_p = p^{-n}$ and $|x|_q = q^{-m}$. But since $q$ and $p$ are distinct [[prime number|primes]] and the whole [[prime ideal]] thing works here, there is no exponent that can transform one to the other. Thus for two finite $p,q$, the $p$- and $q$-adic absolute values are not equivalent.

Now let $y\in \mathbb Q$ be such that if we write $y = p^n\cdot\frac{a}{b}$, either $a\neq 1$ or $b\neq 1$. Then $|x|_p = p^{-n}$ while $|x|_\infty= x$, which is by definition not a power of $p$.
