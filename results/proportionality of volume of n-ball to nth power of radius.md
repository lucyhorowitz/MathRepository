## Theorem
Let $B_n(0,a)$ be the [[closed]] ball of radius $a$ in $\mathbb R^n$ centered at 0. Then it has [[volume of a rectifiable set|volume]] $$\text{vol}(B_n(0,a)) = a^n\text{vol}(B_n(0,1)).$$
## Proof
#write_proof [[simple region]] [[rectifiable]] [[volume of a the linear image of a rectifiable set]] [[determinant]] [[invariance of determinant]]
