## Theorem
Let $G$ be a [[group]] [[group action|acting]] on a set $X$. Then for any $g\in G$, the [[stabilizer under group action|stabilizer]] $\text{Stab}(g\cdot x)$ is equal to the [[image]] of $\text{Stab}(x)$ under the [[inner automorphism of a group|inner automorphism]] given by $g$. That is, $$\text{Stab}(g\cdot x) = g\text{Stab}(x)g^{-1} = \varphi_g(\text{Stab}(x)).$$
