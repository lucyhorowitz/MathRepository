## Theorem
Every [[principal ideal domain]] is a [[unique factorization domain]].
## Proof
Let $R$ be a [[principal ideal domain]] and let $r\in R$ be some non-[[unit of a ring|unit]] element. [[irreducible element of an integral domain|irreducible]] [[ring ideal|ideal]] [[intersection of ring ideals is an ideal]] [[principal ideal]] [[generate a ring ideal]] [[division in a ring|divides]] [[associate elements in an integral domain]] [[induction]]
