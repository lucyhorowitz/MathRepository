## Theorem
Let $(X, \Sigma,\mu)$ be a [[measure space]]. If $A$ and $B$ are [[measurable]] sets in $\Sigma$ such that $A\subseteq B$, then $$\mu(A)\leq \mu(B).$$
## Proof
By [[finite additivity of measure|finite additivity]], we have $\mu(B) = \mu(A) + \mu(B\setminus A)$, and monotonicity follows immediately.
