## Theorem
Let $Q\subset\mathbb R^n$ be a [[rectangle]] and let $\{Q_i\}_{i=1}^k$ be a finite collection of [[rectangle|rectangles]] such that $Q \subset \bigcup\limits_{i=1}^k Q_i$. Then the [[volume]] of $Q$ is less than or equal to the sum of the [[volume|volumes]] of the union of the $Q_i$:
$$ \text{vol}(Q) \leq \sum_{i=1}^k \text{vol}(Q_i).$$
