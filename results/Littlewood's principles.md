## Theorem
1. Let $E\subset\mathbb R$ be of finite [[Lebesgue measure]]. Then for all $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists a finite, pairwise disjoint collection of [[open]] [[interval|intervals]] $\{I_n\}_{n=1}^k$ such that $$\mu\left(E\setminus\ \bigcup_{n=1}^k I_n\right) + \mu\left(\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^k I_n\right)\setminus E\right) < \varepsilon.$$ That is, the [[symmetric difference]] is less than $\varepsilon$.
2. [[Lusin's theorem]]
3. [[Egorov's theorem]]
>"There are three principles, roughly expressible in the following terms: Every [[measurable]] set is nearly a finite sum of intervals; every function (of class [[Lp space|Lp]]) is nearly [[continuous]]; every [[pointwise convergence|convergent]] sequence of functions is nearly [[uniform convergence|uniformly convergent]]."
