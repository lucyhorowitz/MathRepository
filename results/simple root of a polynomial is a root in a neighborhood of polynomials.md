## Theorem
Let $p \in \mathbb P_n$ be a [[polynomial]] such that $x_0$ is a root of [[multiplicity of polynomial roots|multiplicity]] 1. Then there exists a [[neighborhood]] $U \subset \mathbb P_n$ of $p$ and a [[smooth]] function $r:U\to\mathbb R$ such that $r(p) = x_0$ and for all $q \in U$, $r(q)$ is a root of $q$.
