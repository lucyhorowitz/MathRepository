## Theorem
Let $T: V\to V$ be a [[linear transformation]] from the $n$-[[dimension of vector space|dimensional]] [[definitions/vector space]] $V$ to itself. Given any [[basis]] for $V$, the [[trace]] of $T$ is given by the sum of the diagonal entries of the [[matrix]] representation of $T$ with respect to that [[basis]]. That is, for $A = (a_{ij})$ a [[matrix]] for $T$, $$\text{tr}(T) = \sum_{i=1}^n a_{ii}.$$
## Proof
#write_proof  [[isomorphism between tensor product of dual space and new vector space and maps from vector space to new vector space]] [[linear transformation]]
