## Theorem
Let $G$ be a [[group]] [[group action|acting]] on a finite set $X$ and choose $x\in X$. Then the [[cardinality]] of the [[orbit]] of $x$ is equal to the [[index of a subgroup|index]] of the [[stabilizer under group action|stabilizer]] of $x$ in $G$, which is further equal to the [[order of a group|order]] of $G$ divided by the [[order of a group|order]] of the [[stabilizer under group action|stabilizer]] of $x$. That is, $$|\text{orb}(x)| = [G:\text{Stab}(x)] = \frac{|G|}{|\text{Stab}(x)|}.$$
