## Theorem
The following three statements are equivalent for a [[group]] $G$:
1. The [[derived series of a group|derived series]] of $G$ terminates after finitely many steps;
2. $G$ has a [[normal series]] with [[abelian]] [[composition series|composition factors]];
3. $G$ is [[solvable group|solvable]].
## Proof
#write_proof [[characteristic subgroup]] [[normal subgroup]] [[quotient by normal subgroup]] [[abelian]] [[commutator subgroup]]
