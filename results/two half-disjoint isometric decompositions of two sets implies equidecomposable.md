## Theorem
Suppose that $A = A_1\cup\cdots A_n$ and $B= B_1\cup\cdots\cup B_n$ such that the $A_i$ are pairwise disjoint and $A_i$ and $B_i$ are [[isometry|isometric]] for all $i$, and that $A = C_1\cup\cdots C_m$ and $B= D_1\cup\cdots\cup D_m$ such that the $D_j$ are pairwise disjoint and $C_j$ and $D_j$ are [[isometry|isometric]] for all $j$. Then $A$ and $B$ are [[equidecomposable]].
## Proof
For each $1\leq i\leq n$, let $\phi_i: A_i\to B_i$ be an [[isometry]]. Then choose $A_i'\subseteq A$ such that the $\phi_i(A_i')$ are pairwise disjoint and such that $B = \phi_1(A_1')\cup\cdots\cup\phi_n(A_n')$. Denote their union $A' = A_1'\cup\cdots\cup A_n'$. Similarly, for each $1\leq j\leq m$, leq $\psi_j: D_j \to C_j$ be an [[isometry]], and choose $D_j' \subseteq D_j$ such that the $\psi_j(D_j')$ are pairwise disjoint and $A=\psi_1(D_1')\cup\cdots\cup \psi_m(D_m')$. $B' = B_1'\cup\cdots\cup B_m'$ Then we have both that $A'$ and $B$ are [[equidecomposable]] and so are $A$ and $B'$. [[equidecomposition of subsets|Thus]] $A$ and $B$ are [[equidecomposable]].
