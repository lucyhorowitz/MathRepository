## Theorem
Let $V$ and $W$ be [[vector space|vector spaces]] and $\phi:G\to GL(V)$ and $\psi: G\to GL(W)$ be [[irreducible representation|irreducible]] [[group representation|representations]] of the [[group]] $G$. Let $T: V\to W$ be an [[morphism of group representations|intertwiner]] of $\phi$ and $\psi$. Then:
1. either $T$ is an [[linear transformation|isomorphism]] or it is identically zero;
2. if $V=W$, then the [[matrix of a linear transformation|matrix]] of $T$ is $\lambda I$ for some $\lambda \in \mathbb C$.
