## Theorem
Let $G$ be a finite [[group]]. Then if the [[Frattini subgroup]] is a [[subgroup]] of a [[normal subgroup|normal]] [[subgroup]] $N$ of $G$ and the [[quotient by normal subgroup|quotient]] $N/\Phi(G)$ is [[nilpotent group|nilpotent]], then so is $N$.
## Proof
[[characteristic subgroup|characteristic]] [[Frattini subgroup is characteristic]] [[Sylow p-subgroup|p-Sylow subgroup]] [[finite group is nilpotent iff all Sylow p-subgroups are unqiue]] [[product of subgroups]] [[Frattini argument]] [[normalizer of a group]] [[subgroups of finite groups are contained in maximal subgroups]]
