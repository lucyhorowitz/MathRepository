## Theorem
If a [[tree]] $T$ is a [[subgraph]] of a [[graph]] $X$, then $T$ is contained in a [[maximal subtree]]. If $X$ is [[connected graph|connected]], then  a [[tree]] in $X$ is [[maximal subtree|maximal]] if and only if it contains all vertices of $X$.
## Proof
[[Zorn's lemma]] [[connected graph]] [[reduced edge path]] [[closed edge path]] [[subgraph]]
