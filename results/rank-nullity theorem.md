## Theorem (vector space version, less general)
Let $T:V\to W$ be a [[linear transformation]] between finite-[[dimension of vector space|dimensional]] [[vector space|vector spaces]] $V$ and $W$. Then the [[dimension of vector space|dimension]] of $V$ is equal to the sum of the [[rank]] and [[nullity]] of $T$. That is,
$$\text{dim}(V) = \text{rank}(T) + \text{null}(T).$$
## Proof
#write_proof  [[dimension of vector subspaces is ordered]] [[span]] [[existence of linear complement]] [[injective]] [[injective and surjective are equivalent for finite-dimensional linear transformations]] 
## Theorem (module version)
Let $R$ be a [[ring]] and let $M$ and $N$ be [[finite length R-module|finite length]] $R$-[[module over a ring|modules]]. Let $f:M\to N$ be a [[module homomorphism]]. Then the [[length of a module|length]] $N$ is equal to the sum of the [[length of a module|length]] of the [[image]] of $f$ plus the [[length of a module|length]] of the [[kernel]] of $f$.
