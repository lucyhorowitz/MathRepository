## Theorem
Let $(X,\Sigma, \mu)$ be a [[measure space]] and let $\mu(X) < \infty$. Suppose that for every $A\in \Sigma$ with $0 < \mu(A)$ there is a subset $B\subset A$ with $B \in \Sigma$, $0 < \mu(B) < \mu(A)$. Then for every $0 \leq c \leq \mu(A)$ there is a subset $B\subset A$ with $B \in \Sigma$, $\mu(B) = c$.
## Proof      
Without loss of generality, let $\mu(X) = 1$. First, we wish to show that for all $B \in \Sigma$ such that $\mu(B) > 0$, there exists measurable $A \subset B$ such that $\mu(A) \in \left(\frac{1}{4}\mu(B),\frac{1}{2}\mu(B)\right]$. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that there is no such set. Immediately we have that there is no measurable $A\subset B$ for which $\mu(A) \in \left[\frac{1}{2}\mu(B), \frac{3}{4}\mu(B)\right)$. This is because the complement $B\setminus A$ would be as we have just assumed the nonexistence. Thus it must be that for any measurable $A\subset B$, the measure $\mu(A) \in \left[0, \frac{1}{2}\mu(B)\right] \cup \left[ \frac{3}{4} \mu(B), \mu(B)\right]$. Now we define the set $$\mathcal C =\left\{ A \in \Sigma \mid A\subset B \land \mu(A) \geq \frac{3}{4}\mu(B)\right\}.$$ Because $B \in \mathcal C$, it is nonempty, and moreover it is closed under finite intersections. This is because by excision of subsets, for $C,D \in \mathcal C$, $$\mu(C\cap D) = \mu(C) + \mu(D) - \mu(C\cup D) \geq \left(\frac{3}{4} + \frac{3}{4} + 1\right) \mu(B) = \frac{1}{2}\mu(B).$$ But for all $A\subset B$ such that $\mu(A) \geq \frac{1}{2}\mu(B)$, we have $\mu(A) \geq \frac{3}{4}\mu(B)$ and consequently $A \in\mathcal C$ by the assumptions above.

Now define $\alpha = \inf\limits_{A \in \mathcal C} \mu(A)$. We have that $\alpha \geq \frac{3}{4}\mu(B)$ and that for all $n \in \mathbb N$, there exists $A_n \in \mathcal C$ such that $\mu(A_n) < \alpha + \frac{1}{n}$. Define a sequence $\{B_n\}_{n\in\mathbb N}$ of sets in $\mathcal C$ by $B_1 = A_1$ and $B_{n+1} = B_n \cap A_{n+1}$ for all $n \geq 2$. This is a decreasing sequence of subsets, and the intersection $G = \bigcap\limits_{n\in\mathbb N} B_n$ is also in $\mathcal C$ with $\mu(G) =\alpha$ because for all $n$, $\alpha < \mu(G) <\alpha + \frac{1}{n}$. By assumption, this means there exists $H \subset G$ with $\mu(H) \in \left[\frac{\alpha}{2}, \alpha\right)$. But because $\alpha \geq \frac{3}{4}$, it must be that $G \in \mathcal C$, contradicting the [[infimum|minimality]] of $\alpha$. Thus there must be a set $A\subset B$ for which $\mu(A) \in \left(\frac{1}{4}\mu(B), \frac{1}{2}\mu(B)\right]$.

If we consider the whole space $X$, we then immediately have that there exists a set $B\in \Sigma$ for which $\mu(B) \in \left(\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{2}\right]$. We use induction to show that there must also exist a set $C \in\Sigma$ such that $C \subset X\setminus B$ and $\mu(C) \in \left[\frac{2}{4^n}, \frac{3}{2\cdot 2^n}\right)$. From above we know that the base case holds, i.e. that $\mu(X\setminus B) \in\left[\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{4}\right)$. Now suppose that for some $n \geq 2$ there exists $C \subset X\setminus B$ such that $\mu(C) \in \left[\frac{2}{4^n},\frac{3}{2\cdot 2^n}\right)$. By the above result, there exists $D\subset C$ such that $\mu(D) \in \left\\frac{2}{4^{n+1}}, \frac{3}{2\cdot 2^{n+1}}\right)$, and moreover $D\subset S\setminus B$ as desired.

This means that in the limit, we can find a set $A \in \Sigma$ with $\mu(A) = \frac{1}{2}$. Moreover, we can find a sequence of sets $\{A_r\}_{r \in \mathbb Q_2}$ in $\Sigma$ such that $\mu(A_r) = r$ and $r < s$ implies $A_r \subset A_s$ where the set $\mathbb Q_2$ is $$\left\{\frac{m}{2^n} \mid m\in\mathbb Z, n\in\mathbb N\right\}\cap [0,1].$$ For $x \in [0,1]$, let $B_x = \bigcup_{y<x} A_y$ for $y \in \mathbb Q_2$. By construction, $\mu(B_x) = x$, as desired.
