## Theorem
Let $I$ be a [[solvable Lie algebra|solvable]] [[ideal of a Lie algebra|ideal]] of the [[Lie algebra]] $L$ such that $L/I$ is also [[solvable Lie algebra|solvable]]. Then $L$ itself is [[solvable Lie algebra|solvable]].
## Proof
Suppose that $(L/I)^{(n)} = \{0\}$ and let $\pi: L\to L/I$ be the [[definitions/canonical map]]. Because [[all homomorphic images of a solavble Lie algebra are solvable|all homomorphic images]] and [[all subalgebras of a solvable Lie algebra are solvable|subalgebras of a solvabel Lie algebra are solvable]], $(L/I)^{(n)} = \{0\}$ implies that $\pi(L^{(n)})=\{0\}$. Equivalently, $L^{(n)} \subset I = \text{Ker}(\pi)$ by definition of the [[kernel of Lie algebra homomorphism|kernel]] of $\pi$. If $I^{(m)}=\{0\}$, then $(L^{(i)})^{(j)} = L^{(i+j)}$ implies that $L^{(n+m)} = \{0\}$ again because [[all homomorphic images of a solavble Lie algebra are solvable|all homomorphic images]] and [[all subalgebras of a solvable Lie algebra are solvable|subalgebras of a solvabel Lie algebra are solvable]].
