## Theorem
Let $(X,\Sigma,\mu)$ be a [[measure space]] with $A \in \Sigma$. Then the following results about the [[measure density]] hold:
1. $d(A,x) = 1$ for [[almost everywhere|almost every]] $x \in A$.
2. $d(X\setminus A,x) =1$ for [[almost everywhere|almost every]] $x \in X\setminus A$. 
3. $d(A,x) = 0$ for [[almost everywhere|almost every]] $x \in X\setminus A$.
4. $d(X\setminus A, x) = 0$ for [[almost everywhere|almost every]] $x \in A$. 

Note that (1) and (2) hold in nonmeasurable sets, but that (3) and (4) are only true if and only if $A$ is [[measurable]].
## Proof
1. Let $H$ be a [[measurable hull]] of $A\subset X$ (it is not necessary that $A\in \Sigma$). Then for any ball $B(x,r)$, the intersection $H\cap B(x,r)$ [[measurable hull of intersections|is a measurable hull]] of $H\cap A$. Thus the [[measure density|density]] is $$d(A,x) = \lim_{r\to 0} \frac{\mu(A\cap B(x,r))}{\mu(B(x,r))} = \lim_{r\to 0} \frac{\mu(H\cap B(x,r))}{\mu(B(x,r))} = d(H,x),$$ where if $A\cap B(x,r)$ is not [[measurable]] we use the [[induced outer measure]] in place of $\mu$. By the [[Lebesgue density theorem]], this last term is equal to 1 for [[almost everywhere|almost every]] $x \in H$, and [[difference of set and measurable hull is measure zero|therefore]](?) [[almost everywhere|almost every]] $x \in A$. 
2. The proof is the same as for (1), considering the complement of $A$ instead of $A$ itself.
3. Suppose first that $A$ is [[measurable]]. Then by the [[Lebesgue density theorem]], the [[measure density|density]] $d(A,x) = 1$ for [[almost everywhere|almost every]] $x \in A$. Moreover, $$\begin{align*}1 &= d(X,x)\\ &= d(A\cup (X\setminus A), x)\\ &= \lim_{r\to 0} \frac{\mu((A\cup (X\setminus A))\cap B(x,r))}{\mu(B(x,r))}\\ &= \lim_{r\to 0}\frac{\mu(A\cap B(x,r))}{\mu(B(x,r))} + \lim_{r\to 0}\frac{\mu((X\setminus A)\cap B(x,r))}{\mu(B(x,r))}\\ &= d(A,x)+d(X\setminus A,x)\\ &= 1+d(X\setminus A,x).\end{align*}$$ Thus for [[almost everywhere|almost every]] $x\in A$, $d(X\setminus A,x) =0$. Now suppose that $d(A,x)=1$ and $d(X\setminus A,x) =0$ for [[almost everywhere|almost every]] $x \in A$ and let $H$ be a [[measurable hull]] of $A$ and $H'$ a [[measurable hull]] of $X\setminus A$. 
	- We have by set algebra that $A = H \setminus (H\setminus A)$. Suppose first that $\mu(H\cap H') =0$. But $H\setminus A \subset H\cap H'$ so $\mu(H\setminus A)=0$. Since [[σ-algebra|σ-algebras]] are closed under relative complements, it must be that $A$ is measurable.
	- Now suppose that $\mu(H\cap H')>0$. Then for  [[almost everywhere|almost every]] $x \in H\cap H'$, $$1 = d(H\cap H', x) \leq d(H',x) = d(X\setminus A, x).$$ Thus $d(X\setminus A,x)=1$ for  [[almost everywhere|almost every]]  $x \in H\cap H'$. Because $H\cap H'$ [[measurable hull of intersections|is a measurable hull of]] $A\cap H'$, it must be that $\mu(A\cap H') > 0$. But this implies that $$\mu(x \in A\cap H'\mid d(X\setminus A, x) =1\} >0,$$ so that $A$ is not [[measurable]] by the previous direction of this result.
