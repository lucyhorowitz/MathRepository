## Theorem
Let $G$ be a finite [[group]] and let $g_1,g_2,\dots, g_r$ be [[equivalence class|representatives]] of the distinct [[conjugacy classes]] of $G$ not contained in the [[center of a group|center]] $Z(G)$ of $G$. Then $$|G| = |Z(G)| +\sum_{i=1}^r [G:C_G(g_i)].$$ That is, the [[order of a group|order]] of $G$ is equal to the [[order of a group|order]] of the [[center of a group|center]] of $G$ plus the sum of the [[index of a subgroup|indices]] of the [[centralizer of a subset|centralizers]] of the $g_i$.
