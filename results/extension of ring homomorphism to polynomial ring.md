## Theorem
Let $R$ and $S$ be [[ring|rings]], let $X$ be a finite set and let $f:X\to S$ be a function such that $f(x)$ and $f(y)$ [[commutative|commute]] for all $x,y\in X$. Let $g:R\to S$ be a [[ring homomorphism]]. Then there exists a [[ring homomorphism]] from the [[polynomial ring]] $R[X]$ to $S$ given by $$\sum_I a_I x_1^{I_1}\cdots x_n^{I_n} \mapsto \sum_I g(a_I)f(x_1)^{I_1}\cdots f(x_n)^{I_n}.$$ Moreover, this is the unique [[ring homomorphism|homomorphism]] extending $g$ and $f$.
