## Theorem
Let $G$ be a finite [[abelian]] [[group]]. Then $G$ can be expressed as the [[direct sum of groups|direct sum]] of [[cyclic group|cyclic]] [[subgroup|subgroups]] of prime-power [[order of a group|order]].

Specifically, any finite [[abelian]] [[group]] $G$ is [[group homomorphism|isomorphic]] to a [[direct sum of groups|direct sum]] $$\bigoplus_{i=1}^r \mathbb Z/k_i\mathbb Z$$ in such a way that either 
1. the $k_i$ are powers of not-necessarily-distinct primes;
2. $k_i$ divides $k_{i+1}$ for all $1\leq i < r$.
