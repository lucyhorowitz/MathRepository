## Theorem
Let $\mathcal A$ be a collection of [[open]] sets in $\mathbb R^n$ and let $A$ be their union. Then there exists a countable collection $\{Q_i\}_{i\in\mathbb N}$ of [[rectangle|rectangles]] contained in $A$ such that 
1. the [[interior|interiors]] $\text{int}(Q_i)$ cover $A$.
2. each $Q_i$ is contained in an element of $\mathcal A$.
3. each point of $A$ has a neighborhood that intersects only finitely many of the $Q_i$.
