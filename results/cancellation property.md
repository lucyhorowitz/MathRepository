## Theorem
A [[ring]] $R$ has no [[zero divisor|zero divisors]] if and only if it satisfies the following cancellation property: For every $r\in R/\{0\}$ and every $s_1,s_2\in R$, if $rs_1=rs_2$ then $s_1=s_2$.  That is, $R$ has no [[zero divisor|zero divisors]] if you can always divide by nonzero elements.
