## Theorem
Let $(X,\rho)$ be a [[complete metric space|complete]] [[metric space]]. Then a set $K \subseteq X$ is [[compact]] if and only if every [[continuous]] function $f:K\to \mathbb R$ attains a global maximum and a global minimum.
## Proof
#write_proof [[continuous functions preserve compactness]] [[sequentially compact]] [[convergent sequences are Cauchy]]
