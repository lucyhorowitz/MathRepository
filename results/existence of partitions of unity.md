## Theorem
Let $\mathcal A$ be a collection of [[open]] sets in $\mathbb R^n$. Let $A$ be their union. Then there exists a sequence $\phi_i$ of [[continuous]] functions $\phi_i : \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R$ such that 
1. $\phi(x) \geq 0$ for all $x$.
2. the [[support]] $S_i = \text{supp}(\phi_i)$ is contained in $A$.
3. each point of $A$ has a neighborhood that intersects only finitely many of the $S_i$.
4. $\sum\limits_{i\in\mathbb N} \phi_i(x) = 1$ for each $x \in A$. 
5. the $\phi_i$ are [[smooth]].
6. the sets $S_i$ are [[compact]].
7. for each $i$, the set $S_i$ is contained in an element of $A$.

Such a sequence is a [[partition of unity]].
