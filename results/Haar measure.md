## Theorem
Let $G$ be a [[locally compact group|locally compact]] [[topological group|topological]] [[group]]. Up to a positive multiplicative constant, there is a unique countably additive nontrivial [[measure space|measure]] $\mu$ on the [[Borel σ-algebra|Borel]] subsets of $G$ satisfying
- Left translation invariance. That is, $\mu(gS)=\mu(S)$ for all $g\in G$ and all [[Borel σ-algebra|Borel sets]] $S\subseteq G$;
- Finite on every [[compact]] set. That is, $\mu(K) <\infty$ for all [[compact]] $K\subseteq G$;
- [[outer regular|Outer regular]] on [[Borel σ-algebra|Borel sets]]. That is, $\mu(S) = \inf\{\mu(U)\mid S\subseteq U, U \text{ open}\}$ where $\text{inf}$ denotes the [[infimum]] over [[open]] subsets of $G$;
- [[inner regular|Inner regular]] on [[open]] subsets. That is, $\mu(U) = \sup\{\mu(K)\mid K\subseteq U, K\text{ compact}\}$ where $\text{sup}$ denotes the [[supremum]] over [[compact]] subsets.


Such a [[measure space|measure]] is a **left Haar measure**. You can get a **right** Haar measure by changing left to right in the first condition.
