## Theorem
Every [[subgroup]] $H$ of an [[abelian]] [[group]] $G$ is a [[normal subgroup]].
## Proof
We need to show that for every element $g\in G$, the [[left coset]] $gH$ is equal to the [[right coset]] $Hg$. Note that $gH = \{gh\mid h\in H\}$. Because $G$ is [[abelian]], we may write every element $gh \in gH$ as $hg$. Thus $$gH = \{gh\mid h\in H\} = \{hg\mid h\in H\} = Hg$$ as desired.
