## Theorem
If $L$ is a [[solvable Lie algebra|solvable]] [[Lie algebra]], $M$ a [[Lie algebra]], and $\phi: L\to M$ a [[Lie algebra homomorphism|homomorphism]], then $\text{im}(\phi)$ is also [[solvable Lie algebra|solvable]].
## Proof
We proceed by induction on the term of the [[derived series of a Lie algebra|derived series]]. Suppose without loss of generality that $\phi$ is an [[epimorphism of Lie algebras|epimorphism]]. Then $\phi(L^{(i)}) = M^{(i)}$, so when $L^{(n)} =\{0\}$, it must be that $M^{(n)} = \{0\}$.
