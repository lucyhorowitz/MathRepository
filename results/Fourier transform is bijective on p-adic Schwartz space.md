## Theorem
Denote the [[Schwartz space]] of the [[p-adic field]] by $C_c^\infty(\mathbb Q_p)$ and let $\mathcal F: C_c^\infty(\mathbb Q_p)\to C_c^\infty(\mathbb Q_p)$ be the map given by $\mathcal F(f) = \widehat f$, where the hat denotes the [[Fourier transform over Qp]]. Then $\mathcal F$ is a [[bijective|bijection]] and moreover if $f$ has [[support]] on the $m$th power of [[curly P]] $\mathcal P^m$ and is constant on [[left coset|cosets]] of $\mathcal P^n$, then $\widehat f$ has [[support]] on $\mathcal P^{-n}$ and is constant on [[left coset|cosets]] of $\mathcal P^{-m}$.
