## Theorem
Let $f:\mathbb R^2 \to \mathbb R$ be such that $f(x,\cdot)$ is [[Lebesgue measure|Lebesgue]] [[measurable function|measurable]] for all $x$ and $f(\cdot, y)$ is [[continuous]] for every $y$. Then $f$ is [[Lebesgue measure|Lebesgue]] [[measurable function|measurable]].
## Proof
We can construct a sequence $\{f_n\}_{n\in\mathbb N}$ of [[Lebesgue measure|Lebesgue]] [[measurable]] functions [[pointwise convergence|converging pointwise]] to $f$ as follows: For every $i \in \mathbb Z$, let $a_i = i/n$, and define for $a_i \leq x \leq a_{i+1}$ $$f_n(x,y) = \frac{f(a_{i+1},y)(x-a_i)-f(a_i, y)(x-a_{i+1})}{a_{i+1}-a_i}.$$ Since $f$ is [[continuous]] in the first coordinate, each $f_n$ is [[Lebesgue measure|Lebesgue]] [[measurable function|measurable]] in the first coordinate because [[continuous functions are Borel]] and the [[Borel σ-algebra is contained in the Lebesgue σ-algebra]]. Because the identity function $x$ is also [[Lebesgue measure|Lebesgue]] [[measurable function]], each $f_n$ is [[Lebesgue measure|Lebesgue]] [[measurable function|measurable]] on $\\mathbb R^2$ as the composition, sum, and scalar multiple of Lebesgue measurable functions. Because $f\_n$ [[pointwise convergence|converges pointwise]] to $f$, we have that $f$ itself is Lebesgue measurable.
