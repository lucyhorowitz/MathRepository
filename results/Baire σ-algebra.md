## Theorem
The subsets $S$ of a [[topological space]] $X$ satisfying the [[Baire property]] form a [[σ-algebra]].
## Proof
1. Clearly, $\emptyset$ is [[Baire property|Baire]] because it is both [[meager|first category]] and [[open]], and we have the [[symmetric difference]] $\emptyset\triangle\emptyset=\emptyset$. The space $X$ is [[Baire property|Baire]] because it is [[open]], and we have $X\triangle X = \emptyset$, which as we said before is [[meager|first category]].
2. Suppose that $S$ is [[Baire property|Baire]]. [[symmetric difference of complements|Then]] $S\triangle G = (X\setminus S)\triangle(X\setminus G)$ is [[meager|first category]]. Because for all sets $A,B,C$ [[properties of symmetric difference|we have]] $$(A\triangle B) \triangle (B\triangle C) = A\triangle C$$ and $(A\triangle B)\subseteq A\cup B$, if we can find an [[open]] set $H$ such that $(X\setminus G) \triangle H$ is of [[meager|first category]], we will have that $A\triangle H$ is also fo [[meager|first category]]. Thus it is sufficient to show that $X\setminus G$ (and therefore all [[closed]] sets) is [[Baire property|Baire]] in order to show that the [[Baire property|Baire]] sets are closed under set complemets. Let $F$ be a [[closed]] set. Then its [[interior]] $\text{int}(F)$ is [[open]], and $$F\triangle (F\setminus \text{int}(F))$$ is [[nowhere dense]], and therefore of [[meager|first category]]. 
3. Let $\{S_i\}_{i\in\mathbb N}$ be a [[countable]] collection of [[Baire property|Baire]] sets in $X$. Then for all $i$, there exists [[open]] $G_i$ such that $A_i\triangle G_i$ is of [[meager|first category]]. [[properties of symmetric difference|Then]] $$\left(\bigcup_{i\in\mathbb N} A_i\right)\triangle \left(\bigcup_{i\in\mathbb N} G_i\right)\subseteq \bigcup_{i\in\mathbb N} (A_i\triangle G_i),$$ which is [[meager|first category]]. Thus $\left(\bigcup_{i\in\mathbb N} A_i\right)$ is [[meager|first category]] as the subset of a [[meager|first category]] set.
