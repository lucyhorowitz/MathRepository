## Theorem
Let $G$ be a [[group]] [[group action|acting]] [[transitive group action|transitively]] on a set $S$. Let $H = G_s$ be the [[stabilizer under group action|isotropy subgroup]] of an element $s\in S$. Then the [[Weyl group]] $WH$ is [[group homomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[automorphism group|group]] $\text{Aut}_G(S)$ of [[equivariant map|G-automorphisms]] of $S$. 
## Proof
Let $NH$ denote the [[normalizer of a group|normalizer]] of $H$. For $n\in NH$ with image $\overline n\in WH$, define an [[equivariant map|automorphism]] $\phi(\overline n)$ of $S$  by $\phi(\overline n)(gs)= gns$. For an [[equivariant map|automorphism]] $\phi$ of $S$, we must have by [[transitive group action|transitivity]] $\phi(s) = ns$ for some $n\in G$. Then for $h\in H$, $hns = \phi(hs) = \phi(s) ns$ which implies that $n^{-1}hn \in G_s=H$ and therefore $n\in NH$. Clearly, $\phi = \phi(\overline n)$, and we can perform a simple check that this [[bijective|bijection]] between $WH$ and $\text{Aut}_G(S)$ forms an [[group homomorphism|isomorphism]] of [[group|groups]].
