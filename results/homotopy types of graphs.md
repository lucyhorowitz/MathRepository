## Theorem
Let $X$ be a [[connected graph]] with [[maximal subtree]] $T$. Then the [[quotient of topological spaces|quotient space]] $X/T$ is the [[wedge sum]] of one circle for each edge of $X$ not in $T$ and the quotient map $q:X\to X/T$ is a [[homotopy equivalence of spaces|homotopy equivalence]].
## Proof
[[cofibration of contractible space is homotopy equivalence]] [[loop]] [[homotopy|homotopic]]  #write_proof
