## Theorem
Let $F$ be a finite [[field]]. Then any [[absolute value]] on $F$ is trivial. That is, $$|x| = \begin{cases} 0 & x=0\\ 1 & x\neq 0.\end{cases}$$
## Proof
We are required by the definition of [[absolute value]] to have $|0| = 0$. Now note that because $1 = 1\cdot 1$, we must have $|1| = |1^2| = |1|^2$. But the only nonzero number that does this in $\mathbb R$ is $1$. Because [[any finite multiplicative subgroup of a field is cyclic]], there must exist for every $x\in F$ some $n\in\mathbb N$ such that $x^n = 1$, and therefore such that $|x^n| = |x|^n = 1$.
