## Theorem
Let $f(x) = \sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty a_nx^n$ be a [[power series]] defined #todo: what's the most general place?. that [[series convergence|converges]] on $D$. Then the [[differentiable|derivative]] of $f(x)$, $$f'(x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty na_nx^{n-1}$$ also [[series convergence|converges]].
## Proof
[[power rule]] #write_proof
