## Theorem
Let $H$ be a [[Hilbert space]] with [[dual space|dual]] $H^*$, and suppose that the function $B: H\times H \to \mathbb R$ is such that 
1. $B$ is [[multilinear|bilinear]];
2. there exists $c_1 > 0$ such that $|B(u,v)| \leq c_1||u||\cdot||v||$ for all $u,v\in H$;
3. There exists $c_2 >0$ such that $B(h,h) \geq c_2 ||h||^2$ for all $h \in H$.

Then for each $\psi \in H^*$, there exists a unique $h \in H$ for which $\phi(u) = B(h,u)$ for all $u \in H$.
