## Theorem
Let $X$ be the [[wedge sum]] of a set of [[path-connected]] [[based topological space|based topological spaces]] $X_i$ each containing a [[contractible]] [[neighborhood]] $V_i$ of its basepoint. Then the [[fundamental group]] $\pi_1(X)$ is the [[coproduct]] of the groups $\pi_1(X_i)$.

## Proof
Let $U_i$ be the union of the $X_i$ and $V_j$ for $j\neq i$. Then we can apply the [[van Kampen theorem for fundamental group|van Kampen theorem]] with $\mathcal O$ the sets $V_i$ *and* their finite intersections. Since any intersection of at least two of the $V_i$ is [[contractible]], their intersections [[fundamental group of contractible space|do not]] make any contribution to the [[colimit of a D-shaped diagram|colimit]], so we are done.
