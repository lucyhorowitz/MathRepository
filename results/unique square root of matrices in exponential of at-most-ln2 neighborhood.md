## Theorem
Let $\varepsilon \in(0, \ln(2))$ and let $U = \exp(B(0, \frac{\varepsilon}{2}))$. Then every $B \in U$ has a unique square root (i.e. a [[matrix]] $A$ such that $A^2 = B$) in $U$ given by the [[exponential of linear transformation|exponential]] of one-half the [[matrix logarithm|logarithm]]. That is, $$C = \exp\left(\frac{1}{2}\ln(B)\right).$$
