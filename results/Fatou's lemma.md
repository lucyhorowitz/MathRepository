## Theorem
Let $(X,\Sigma, \mu)$ be a [[measure space]] and let $E$ be [[measurable]]. Let $\{f_n\}_{n\in\mathbb N}$ be a sequence of $(\Sigma, \mathcal B_{\mathbb R_{\geq 0}})$-[[measurable function|measurable]] functions  $f_n:E\to [0,+\infty]$ (where $\mathcal B_{\mathbb R_{\geq 0}}$ is the [[Borel Ïƒ-algebra]] on $[0,+\infty]$) [[pointwise convergence|converging pointwise]] [[almost everywhere]] to $f$. Then the [[limit infimum]] of the [[Lebesgue integral|integral]] of $f_n$ is greater than or equal to the [[Lebesgue integral|integral]] of $f$. That is, $$\int f d\mu \leq \liminf_{n\to\infty} \int f_n d\mu.$$
## Proof
Let $0 \leq g \leq f$, where $g$ is [[bounded function|bounded]] and [[support|supported]] on a set $E \in \Sigma$ of finite [[measure space|measure]]. Let $g_n(x) = \min (g(x), f_n(x))$ for all $x$. Because we have $g_n(x) \leq g(x)$, we have that $g_n$ is also [[measurable function|measurable]] and [[support|supported]] on $E$. Moreover, $g_n(x)$ [[pointwise convergence|converges pointwise]] [[almost everywhere]] on $E$ to $g$. By the [[bounded convergence theorem]], we have that $\int g_nd\mu$ [[sequence convergence|converges]] to $\int gd\mu$. Moreover, $\int g_nd\mu \leq \int f_nd\mu$ by [[monotonicity of Lebesgue integral|monotonicity]] of the [[Lebesgue integral]]. So because $\lim\limits_{n\to \infty} \int f_nd\mu$ exists, it is equal to the [[limit infimum]] $\liminf\limits_{n\to\infty} \int f_nd\mu$, and we have the inequality $$\int gd\mu = \lim_{n\to\infty} \int g_nd\mu \leq \liminf_{n\to\infty} \int f_nd\mu.$$ If we choose $g_n$ so that $g_n$ [[pointwise convergence|converges]] to $f$, the result holds.
