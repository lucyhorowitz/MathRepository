Let $V$ be the space of all complex $2\times 2$ [[Hermitian]] [[matrix|matrices]] with [[trace]] zero. These elements are of the form $$x=\begin{bmatrix}x_1 & x_2+ix_3 \\ x_2-ix_3 & -x_1\end{bmatrix}$$ for $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3 \in \mathbb R$. $V$ can then be identified with $\mathbb R^3$ so that the [[Euclidean inner product]] on $\mathbb R^3$ can be computed in terms of the [[trace]] of the product of two [[matrix|matrices]] as follows: $$\langle X_1, X_2\rangle = \frac{1}{2}\text{tr}(X_1X_2)$$ for $X_1$, $X_2\in V$. 

Consider the [[special unitary group]] $\text{SU}(2)$ For each $U \in \text{SU}(2)$, define a [[linear transformation]] $\Phi_U: V\to V$ by $\Phi_U(X) = UXU^{-1}$. Because $U$ is [[unitary matrix|unitary]], we have for all $A\in V$ that $$(UAU^{-1})^* = (U^{-1})^*AU^* = UAU^{-1}$$ where $U^*$ denotes the [[conjugate transpose|Hermitian transpose]] of $U$. Thus $UAU^{-1}$ is in fact in $V$. 

Moreover, $\Phi_{U_1U_2} = \Phi_{U_1}\Phi_{U_2}$ and $$\frac{1}{2} \text{tr}((UX_1U^{-1})(UX_2U^{-1}))= \frac{1}{2} \text{tr}(UX_1X_2U^{-1}) = \frac{1}{2}\text{tr}(X_1X_2)$$ because [[trace is invariant under conjugation]] and $U$ is [[unitary matrix|unitary]] and therefore equal to its [[conjugate transpose]]. Therefore $\Phi_U$ preserves the [[inner product]] $\frac{1}{2}\text{tr}(X_1X_2)$ on $V$, so $U\mapsto \Phi_U$ is a [[homomorphism of Lie groups|homomorphism]] of $\text{SU}(2)$ onto the [[orthogonal group]] $\text{O}(3)$. Because [[SU(2) is simply connected]], $\Phi_U \in \text{SO}(3)$ (the [[special orthogonal group]]) for all $U\in \text{SU}(2)$ and consequently the map $\Phi:\text{SU}(2) \to \text{SO}(3)$ which sends $U$ to $\Phi_U$ is a [[continuous]] [[homomorphism of Lie groups|homomorphism]], and moreover the fact that $(-I)X(-I)^{-1}= X$ implies that $\Phi_{-I}$ is the identity of $\text{SO}(3)$. 

This map $\Phi$ is *two*-to-one and [[surjective]] and has [[kernel of linear transformation|kernel]] $\{I,-I\}$.  #write_proof
