## Theorem
Let $E$ and $B$ be [[compactly generated]] [[topological space|topological spaces]] andlet $p:E\to B$ be a [[continuous]] map. Let $\mathcal O$ be a [[numerable]] [[open cover]] of $B$. Then $p$ is a [[fibration]] if and only if $p:p^{-1}(U)\to U$ is a [[fibration]] for every $U\in \mathcal O$.
