## Theorem 
Let $U\subset\mathbb R^n$ be an [[open]] subset and let $f:U\to\mathbb R$ be [[differentiable]] on $U$. Then the unit vector in the direction of the [[gradient]] of $f$ at $a$ gives the largest [[directional derivative]] at $a$. That is, for $v \in S^{n-1}$, $$D_{\nabla f(a)}(f)(a) > D_v(f)(a).$$
