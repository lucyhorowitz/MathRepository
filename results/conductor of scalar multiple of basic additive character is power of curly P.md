## Theorem
Let $\psi$ be the [[Basic Additive Character]] on the [[p-adic field]] $\mathbb Q_p$ Then for any nonzero $u \in \mathbb Q_p$ with $|u|_p = p^{-n}$, if we define [[internal scalar multiple of basic additive character is a character|another]] [[multiplicative character|character]] $\psi_u:\mathbb Q_p\to\mathbb T$ by $\psi_u$ and $x\mapsto \psi(ux)$, this has [[conductor of a multiplicative character|conductor]] equal to the $n$th power of [[curly P]] (that is, it is $\mathcal P^{n}$).
## Proof 
We have that $\psi_u(x) =1$ for all $x\in\mathcal P^{-n}$ if and only if $\psi(ux)= 1$ for all $x\in \mathcal P^{-n}$ by definition. This happens if and only if $|ux|_p \leq 1$ for all $x\in\mathbb P^{n}$ because the [[conductor of a multiplicative character|conductor]] of the [[Basic Additive Character]]  [[conductor of basic additive character is p-adic integers|is]] the [[p-adic integers]] $\mathbb Z_p$. By the usual multiplication rules for any [[absolute value]], this happens if and only if $p^{-n}|x|_p \leq 1$ for all $x\in \mathcal P^{-n}$. But this is just equivalent to $|x|_p \leq p^{n}$, which is the exact condition defining $\mathcal P^{-n}$.
