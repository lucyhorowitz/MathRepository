## Theorem
Let $X,Y:\mathbb R^n\to \mathbb R^n$ be [[linear transformation|linear transformations]]. Then the product of their [[exponential of linear transformation|exponentials]] satisfies $$\text{exp}(tX)\text{exp}(tY) = \text{exp}(t(X+Y) + t^2(XY-YX) + \cdots)$$ where every higher-order term in the sum can be written in terms of the [[commutator]] $[X,Y] = XY-YX$.
