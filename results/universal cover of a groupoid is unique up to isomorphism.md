## Theorem
Let $\mathcal B$ be a [[groupoid]]. The [[universal covering of groupoids|universal]] [[covering of groupoids|covering]] of $\mathcal B$, if it exists, is unique up to [[map of covering of groupoid|isomorphism]] and [[map of coverings of groupoids is a covering|covers]] any other [[covering of groupoids|covering]] of $\mathcal B$. 
## Proof
