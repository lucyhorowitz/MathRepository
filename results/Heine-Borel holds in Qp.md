## Theorem
The [[Heine-Borel theorem]] holds in the [[p-adic field]]. That is, a subset $K\subset\mathbb Q_p$ is [[compact]] if and only if it is [[closed]] and [[bounded]].

## Proof
Let $K$ be a [[closed]] and [[bounded]] subset of $\mathbb Q_p$. We can [[Qp is union of powers of curly P|always]] find $n\in\mathbb Z$ such that $K$ is contained in the $n$th power of [[curly P]]. Then because $\mathcal P^n$ [[curly P is compact|is]] [[compact]] and $K$ is [[closed]] and [[closed subsets of compact sets are compact]], $K$ must be [[compact]].
