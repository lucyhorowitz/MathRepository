## Theorem
Let $(X,\Sigma, \mu)$ be a [[measure space]]. If $A$ and $B$ are [[measurable]] sets in $\Sigma$ such that $A\subseteq B$ and $\mu(A)< \infty$, then $$\mu(B\setminus A) = \mu(B)-\mu(A).$$ Moreover, if $\mu(A) = 0$, then $\mu(B\setminus A) = \mu(B)$.
## Proof
By [[finite additivity of measure|finite additivity]], we have $\mu(B) = \mu(A) + \mu(B\setminus A)$, and excision follows immediately.
