## Theorem
Every [[maximal ring ideal|maximal]] [[ring ideal|ideal]] $I$ of a [[commutative]] [[ring]] $R$ is [[prime ideal|prime]].
## Proof
$I$ [[maximal ring ideal|maximal]] [[commutative ring ideal is maximal iff quotient is a field|implies]] [[quotient]] $R/I$ a [[field]] [[lattice ring isomorphism theorem|implies]] [[commutative ring is a field iff its only proper ideal is trivial|implies]] $R/I$ an [[integral domain]] [[ideal of commutative ring is prime iff quotient is integral domain|implies]] $I$ [[prime ideal|prime]].
