## Theorem
The [[general linear group|general linear groups]] $GL_n(\mathbb R)$ and $GL_n(\mathbb C)$ are both [[topological group|topological groups]].
## Proof
They inherit a [[topological space|topology]] from their natural embeddings in $\mathbb R^{n^2}$ and $\mathbb C^{n^2}$ respectively. And not only is the map $\text{mult}$ [[continuous]], [[matrix multiplication is smooth|it is]] [[smooth]]. We also have that the [[inverse matrix|inverse]] map $\text{inv}$ [[matrix inversion is smooth|is smooth]], too.
