## Theorem
Let $U\subset\mathbb R^n$ be an [[open]] subset and suppose that $f:U\to\mathbb R^m$ is [[differentiable]] at $x_0 \in U$. For $\lambda \in \mathbb R$, let $g_\lambda$ be the function $$g_\lambda(x) = \frac{f(x_0 + \lambda(x-x_0)) - f(x_0)}{\lambda}.$$ Then for every [[compact]] set $K\subset U$, the [[restriction]] $(g_\lambda)_{|K}$ converges uniformly to the [[differentiable|total derivative]]] $Df(x_0)(x-x_0)_{|K}$ as $\lambda \to 0$.
