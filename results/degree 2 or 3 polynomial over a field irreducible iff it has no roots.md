## Theorem
Let $k$ be a [[field]] and let $p\in k[x]$ be an element of the [[polynomial ring]] of [[degree of polynomial|degree]] 2 or 3. Then $p$ is [[irreducible element of an integral domain|irreducible]] if and only if $p$ has no roots in $k$.
## Proof
First, note that a [[polynomial ring]] over an [[integral domain]] [[properties of polynomial ring of integral domain|is]] itself an [[integral domain]], so we can actually talk about [[irreducible element of an integral domain|irreducibility]].
