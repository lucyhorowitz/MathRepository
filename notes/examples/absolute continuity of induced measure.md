## Theorem
For $\mu$ the [[Lebesgue measure]] on $\mathbb R^n$, let $f \in$ [[Lp space|L]]$_1(\mu)$ with $\nu$ the $f$-[[induced measure]].Then $\nu$ is [[absolute continuity of measure|absolutely continuous]] with respect to $\mu$.
## Proof
This follows from definition of the [[Lebesgue integral]], so that $\nu(A) = 0$ whenever $\mu(A) =0$.
