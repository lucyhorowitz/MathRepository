Consider the [[special linear algebra]] $\mathfrak{sl}(2,F)$ for any [[field]] $F$. The [[universal enveloping algebra]] $\mathcal U(\mathfrak{sl}(2,F))$ is a [[free algebra]] [[generate a free algebra|generated]] by $e,f,$ and $g$ subject to the relations $$\begin{align*}ef-fe &= h\\ hf-fh&= -2f\\ he-eh &=2e.\end{align*}$$
Because ( #todo: why?) $$\mathfrak{sl}(2,F) = \text{span}\{e\} + \text{span}\{f\} + \text{span}\{h\},$$ the [[universal enveloping algebra]] $\mathcal U(\mathfrak{sl}(2,F)$ contains $\mathcal U(\text{span}\{e\})$, $\mathcal U(\text{span}\{f\})$, and $\mathcal U(\text{span}\{h\})$. That is, it contains all polynomials in $e$, $f$, and $h$ and all products of these elements.
