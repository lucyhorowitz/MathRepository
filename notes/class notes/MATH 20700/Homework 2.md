### Linear Algebra Done Wrong
### Problem 1
- proved [[existence of linear complement]]

### Problem 2
- proved [[rank-nullity theorem]] for infinite dimensions

### Problem 3
- proved [[finite-dimensional linear transformations are continuous]]
- proved [[finite-dimensional linear transformation is bijective iff it is open]]

### Problem 4
- defined [[isometry]]
- proved [[existence of cluster points of sequence of isometries]]

### Problem 6
- proved [[Cauchy-Schwarz inequality]]

### Problem 7
- proved [[Riesz representation theorem]] for finite-dimensional vector spaces
- something else I can't concisely state #todo 

### Problem 10
- defined [[anti-self-adjoint]]
-  proved [[invertible anti-self-adjoint linear transformations have no nonzero eigenvalues]]

### Problem 11
- proved [[nonzero eigenvectors with distinct eigenvalues are linearly independent]]
- proved [[eigenvalues of a linear transformation are also eigenvalues of its adjoint]]
- proved [[self adjoint linear transformations with zero powers are zero]]
