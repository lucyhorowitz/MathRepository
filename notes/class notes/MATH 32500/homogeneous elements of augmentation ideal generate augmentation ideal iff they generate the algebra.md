## Theorem
Let $B = \bigoplus_{i\geq 0}B_i$ be a [[commutative]] [[graded algebra]] over the [[field]] $k$ such that $B_0 = k$ and let $b_1,\dots, b_p \in B_{>0}$ be homogeneous elements of the [[augmentation ideal]]. These elements [[generate an associative algebra|generate]] $B$ as an [[algebra over a field|algebra]] if and only if they [[generate an algebra ideal|generate]] $B_{>0}$ as an [[algebra ideal|ideal]].
