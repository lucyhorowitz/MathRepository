## Theorem
Let $P$ be a [[partially ordered set]] such that every chain $C$ (a subset of $P$ that is [[total order|totally ordered]]) has an upper bound in $P$ (that is, there exists $S\in P$ such that $X\geq S$ for all $x\in C$). Then $P$ contains at least one maximal element (i.e. an element $M$ such that there exists no $N \in P$ with $N \geq P$).
