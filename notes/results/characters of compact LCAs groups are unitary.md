## Theorem
 Let $A$ be a [[locally compact group|locally compact]] [[abelian]] [[group]] that is also [[compact]] (Just roll with it). Then any [[multiplicative character]] $\psi:A\to \mathbb C^\times$ of $A$ is [[unitary multiplicative character|unitary]].
 
 ## Proof
 Because $\psi$ is by definition [[continuous]] and [[continuous functions preserve compactness]],  the [[image]] $\psi(A)$ must also be [[compact]] in $\mathbb C^\times$ and [[image of group homomorphism is subgroup of codomain|moreover]] a [[subgroup]] of $\mathbb C^\times$. But the only such subgroups are contained in the [[circle group]], #todo prove this so we are done.
