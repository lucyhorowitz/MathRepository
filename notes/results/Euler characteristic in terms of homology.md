## Theorem
Let $X$ be a [[CW complex]]. The [[Euler characteristic]] $\chi(X)$ of $X$ is equal to the alternating sum of the [[rank of a finitely generated abelian group|ranks]] of the [[homology group|homology groups]] of $X$: $$\chi(X)=\sum_n (-1)^n\text{rank}(H_n(X)).$$

## Proof
#write_proof [[ranks of finitely generated abelian groups in short exact sequence]] [[chain complex]] [[generating set of a group]] [[homology group|boundary]] [[homology group|cycle]] [[quotient by subgroup]][[relative homology groups]]
