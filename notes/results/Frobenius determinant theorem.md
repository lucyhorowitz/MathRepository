## Theorem
Let $G = \{g_i\}_{i=1}^n$ be a finite [[group]]. Let $X_G$ be the [[matrix]] with entries $a_ij = x_{g_ig_j}$. Then its [[determinant]] is given by $$\det(X_G) = \prod_{j=1}^r P_j(x_{g_1},\dots,x_{g_n})^{\text{deg}(P_j)}$$ where the $P_j$ are [[irreducible element of an integral domain|irreducible]] [[polynomial ring|polynomials]] over $\mathbb C$, and they are each raised to the power of their [[degree of polynomial|degree]].
