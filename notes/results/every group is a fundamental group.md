## Theorem
For any [[group]] $G$, there is a [[connected]] [[topological space]] $X$ whose [[fundamental group]] is [[group homomorphism|isomorphic]] to $G$. 
## Proof
[[every group is a quotient of a free group|Write]] $G$ as a [[quotient by normal subgroup|quotient]] $F/N$ for some [[free group]] $F$ and some [[normal subgroup]] $N$ of $F$. As in the proof that a [[subgroup of free group is free]], we can realize the inclusion of $N$ in $F$ as a passing to [[fundamental group]] from a [[covering space|cover]] $p:E\to B$. The [[cone]] on $E$ is $CE = (E\times I)/(E\times \{1\})$ and define $X=B\cup_p CE/(\sim)$ as the [[quotient by equivalence relation|quotient]] where the [[equivalence relation]] $\sim$ is given by $(e,0)\sim p(e)$. Let $U$ and $V$ be the [[image]] in $X$ of $B\amalg (E\times [0,3/4))$ and $E\times (1/4,1]$ respectively. Choose a basepoint in $E\times \{1/2\}$. Since $U$ and $U\cap V$ are [[homotopy equivalence of spaces|homotopy equivalent]] to $B$ and $E$ via "evident" ( #todo: what?) [[deformation retraction|deformations]] and $V$ is [[contractible]], the [[van Kampen theorem]] gives the result.
