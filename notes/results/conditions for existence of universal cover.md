## Theorem
Let $B$ be a [[topological space]]. If $B$ is [[connected]], [[locally path-connected]], and [[semi-locally simply connected]], then $B$ admits a [[universal covering space|universal cover]].
## Proof
Fix a basepoint $b\in B$. What properties of [[path|paths]] must hold in the [[universal covering space|universal cover]]?

Let $E$ be the set of [[homotopy equivalence of paths|equivalence classes of paths]] $f$ in $B$ that start at $b$. Define $p:E\to B$ by $p[f] = f(1)$. Note that $p$ is well-defined, and consequently the set $E$ is just the [[star of an object|star]] in the [[fundamental groupoid]] of $B$: $$E =\text{St}_{\Pi(B)}(b).$$ By hypothesis, the [[topological space|topology]] on $B$ has a [[topological basis|basis]] consisting of the [[path-connected]] [[open]] subsets $U$ of $B$ such that the map between [[fundamental group|fundamental groups]] $\pi_1(U,u)\to \pi_1(B,b)$ is trivial for all $u\in U$. Because $U$ is [[path-connected]], every [[loop]] in $U$ is [[homotopy|homotopic]] to the trivial [[loop]], any two [[path|paths]] $u\to u'$ in $U$ are [[homotopy equivalence of paths|equivalent]] inf $B$. 

We assign to $E$ a [[topological space|topology]] so that $p$ is a [[covering space]] with these $U$ defined above as the [[covering space|fundamental neighborhoods]]. For a [[path]] $f$ in $B$ that starts at $b$ and ends somewhere in $U$, define a subset $U[f]$ of $E$ by $$U[f] = \{[g]\mid [g]=[c\cdot f] \text{ for some } c:I\to U\}.$$ The set of $U[f]$ form a [[topological basis|basis for a topology]] on $E$ because if $U[f]$ and $U'[f']$ are such sets with intersection containing $[g]$, then $$W[g] \subset u[f]\cap U'[f']$$ for any [[open]] set $W$ of $B$ such that $p[g]\in W \subset U\cap U'$. 

For $u\in U$, there is a unique $[g]$ in each $U[f]$ such that $p[g] = u$. Thus $p$ maps $U[f]$ [[homeomorphism|homeomorphically]] onto $U$ and if we choose a basepoint $u$ in each $U$, then the [[inverse image]] $p^{-1}(U)$ is the disjoint union of the $U[f]$ such that $f$ ends at $u$. 

We now just need to show that $E$ must be [[connected]], [[locally path-connected]], and [[simply connected]]. It is clear that $E$ is [[locally path-connected]] by how we defined the [[open]] sets. Let $e=[c_b]$ be a basepoint for $E$. For $[f]\in E$, define a [[path]] $\tilde f:I\to E$ by $\tilde f(s) = [f_s]$ where $f_s(t) = f(st)$. Note that $\tilde f$ is [[continuous]] because each $\tilde f^{-1}(U[g])$ is [[open]] by definition of $U[g]$ and the [[continuous|continuity]] of $f$. Since $\tilde f$ starts at $e$ and ends at $[f]$, we have that $E$ is [[path-connected]]. Moreover, we have $f_s(1)=f(s)$, so $p\circ \tilde f = f$. Then by definition, $$T[f](e) = [\tilde f(1)] = [f].$$ If we consider only [[loop|loops]] $f$ instead of [[path|paths]] $f$, we see that $T[f](e) = e$ if and only if $[f]=e$ as an element of the [[fundamental group]] $\pi_1(B,b)$. Thus the [[group action|action]] of $\pi_1(B,b)$ on the [[fiber]] $F_b$ is [[free group action|free]] and the [[stabilizer under group action|isotropy subgroup]] given by the [[image]] of $\pi_1(B,b)$ under the [[continuous functions induce homomorphisms on homology groups|induced homomorphism]] is trivial.
