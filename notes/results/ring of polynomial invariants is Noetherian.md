## Theorem 
Let $G$ be a [[compact]] [[subgroup]] [[subgroups of general linear groups are topological groups|of]] the [[general linear group]] $\text{GL}_n(\mathbb C)$. Then the [[invariant polynomials under group action|algebra of polynomial invariants]] $P^G$ is [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]]. That is, every [[algebra ideal|ideal]] $J\subset P^G$ is finitely [[generate an algebra ideal|generated]].

## Proof
For any [[algebra ideal|ideal]] $J\subset P^G$, the ideal $P\cdot J = \{f_1b_1+\cdots + f_mb_m\mid f_i\in P\}$ is finitely [[generate an algebra ideal|generated]] by the [[Hilbert's Basis Theorem|Basis Theorem]] because [[fields are Noetherian]]. Choose a finite set $\{f_i\}_{i=1}^p \subset P$ of generators of $P\cdot J$. Each $f_i$ is then a finite sum $$f_i = \sum_{k=1}^{m_i} f_{i,k}b_{i,k}$$  for some $f_{i,k}\in P$ and $b_{i,k}\in J$. Then $\{b_{i,k} \mid 1\leq i\leq p, 1\leq k \leq k_i\}$ is a finite set of generators for $P\cdot J$. Since $b_{i,k}\in J$, we have by the fact that [[polynomial ideal generated by ideal of invariant polynomials has invariants equal to the original ideal|the generators of PJ are generators of J]], we have that $\{b_{i,k}\}$ is also a collection of generators of $J$. Thus every [[algebra ideal|ideal]] $J$ of $P^G$ is finitely [[generate an algebra ideal|generated]], so $P^G$ is [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]].
