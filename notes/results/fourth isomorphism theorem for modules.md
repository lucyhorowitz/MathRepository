## Theorem
Let $R$ be a [[ring]] and let $M$ be an $R$-[[module over a ring|module]]. If $N$ is a [[submodule]] of $M$, then there is a [[bijective|bijection]] between [[submodule|submodules]] of $M$ containing $N$ and the [[submodule|submodules]] of the [[quotient of modules|quotient module]] $M/N$. It is given by $A\mapsto (A+N)/N$ for all $A\supseteq N$, where $A+N$ is the [[sum of modules]].
