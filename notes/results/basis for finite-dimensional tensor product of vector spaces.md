## Theorem
Let $V$ and $W$ be finite-[[dimension of vector space|dimensional]] [[definitions/vector space|vector spaces]] with [[basis|bases]] $v_1,\dots,v_m \in V$ and $w_1,\dots,w_n\in W$ respectively. Then the set of [[tensor product of vector spaces|tensors]] $$v_i\otimes w_j \in V\otimes W$$ for $1\leq i\leq m$, $1\leq j\leq n$ form a [[basis]] for $V\otimes W$.
