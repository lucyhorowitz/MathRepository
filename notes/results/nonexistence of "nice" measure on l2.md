## Theorem
There exists no [[measure space|measure]] on the [[sequence space]] $\ell_2$ for which the [[measure space|measure]] of every ball is positive and finite.
## Proof
Suppose that every ball in $\ell_2$ is of positive, finite [[measure space|measure]] and that this measure is variant under translation. Let $B$ be the unit ball and suppose that $0< \mu(B) = s < \infty$. Since $\ell_2$ is infinite-[[dimension of vector space|dimensional]], $B$ [[unit sphere is compact only in finite dimensional vector spaces|is not compact]]. [[a metric space is compact if and only if it is sequentially compact|Thus]] it is not [[sequentially compact]], so there exists $\varepsilon > 0$ and a sequence $\{x_n\}_{n\in\mathbb N} \subset B$ such that $||x_n-x_m|| > \varepsilon$ for all $m\neq n$. That is, by the [[Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem]], $\{x_n\}$ has no [[sequence convergence|convergent]] subsequence. Then the ball $B(x_n, \varepsilon)\subset B$ is disjoint from $B(x_m,\varepsilon)\subset B$ for all $m\neq n$, and both has positive finite measure $r$ by hypothesis. By the [[Archimedean principle]], there exists a natural number $k$ such that $kr > s$. Thus $$\mu\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^k B(x_n,\varepsilon)\right) = \sum_{n=1}^k \mu(B(x_n, \varepsilon)) = kr > s,$$ contradicting the finite [[monotonicity of measure|monotonicity of measure]], and no such [[measure space|measure]] may exist.
