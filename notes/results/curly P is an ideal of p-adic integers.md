## Theorem
[[curly P|Curly P]] is an [[ring ideal|ideal]] of the [[ring]] [[p-adic integers are a subring of p-adic numbers|of]] [[p-adic integers]].
## Proof
The [[non-Archimedean absolute value|ultrametric inequality]] implies that $\mathcal P$ is a [[subgroup]] as required, and the multiplicative properties of [[absolute value]] and give the required closure under multiplication.
