## Theorem
Let $P$ be a [[partition of a set]] of the [[rectangle]] $Q$ in $\mathbb R^n$ and let $P'$ be a [[refinement]] of $P$. IF $f: Q\to\mathbb R$ is a [[bounded]] function, then the [[lower sum|lower]] and [[upper sum|upper sums]] of $f$ with respect to $P$ and $P'$ behave as follows:
$$ L(f,P) \leq L(f, P')$$ and $$U(f,P')\leq U(f,P).$$
