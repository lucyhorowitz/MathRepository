## Theorem
Let $G$ be a [[p-group]] of [[order of a group|order]] $|G| = p^\alpha$. Then $G$ has a [[normal series]] $$\{e\}\subseteq N_1\subseteq \cdots\subseteq N_k \subseteq G$$ such that the [[order of a group|order]] of each $N_i$ is equal to $p^i$. 
## Proof
#write_proof  [[p-groups have all p-subgroups]] [[maximal subgroups of p-groups are normal of index p]]
