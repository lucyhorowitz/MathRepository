## Theorem
Let $F:[a,b] \to \mathbb R^n$. The following five conditions are equivalent:
1. $F$ is [[absolute continuity|absolutely continuous]];
2. $F$ is [[continuous]], of [[bounded variation]] and is [[Lusin function|Lusin]]
3. $F$ is [[differentiable]] [[almost everywhere]] and $F(a) + \int_a^x F' = F(x)$;
4. There exists a function $f$ such that $f(a)  + \int_a^x f = F(x)$
5. There exists an [[absolute continuity of measure|absolutely continuous]] [[measure space|measure]] $\mu$ such that $F(x) = \mu((-\infty,x])$.
