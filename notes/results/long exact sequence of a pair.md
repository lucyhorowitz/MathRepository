## Theorem
Let $(X,A)$ be a [[exact sequence on reduced homology of space and retractable subspace]]. Then the sequence of [[homology group|homology groups]] and [[relative homology groups|relative homology groups]] $$\cdots \to H_n(A) \to H_n(X) \to H_n(X,A) \to H_{n-1}(A) \to H_{n-1}(X) \to\cdots \to H_0(X,A)\to 0$$ is [[exact sequence|exact]].
## Proof
This follows directly from the [[homology group|homology groups]] of the [[short exact sequence of chain complexes]] where $(A,B,C) = (A, X, (X,A))$ or something close to that.
