## Theorem
Let ![[Screen Shot 2021-11-04 at 11.47.46 AM.png]] be a [[short exact sequence of chain complexes]]. Then the ("flattened") sequence of [[homology group|homology groups]]
$$\cdots\to H_n(A)\to H_n(B) \to H_n(C) \to H_{n-1}(A) \to H_{n-1}(B) \to \cdots$$ where the first arrow is the [[continuous functions induce homomorphisms on homology groups|induced homomorphism]] $i_*$, the second arrow is the [[continuous functions induce homomorphisms on homology groups|induced homomorphism]] $j_*$, and the map that goes down an index is [[continuous functions induce homomorphisms on homology groups|induced]] by $\partial$ is [[exact sequence|exact]].
## Proof
#write_proof [[homology class]] [[image]][[kernel of group homomorphism]] [[surjective]] [[injective]]
