## Theorem
Let $f:X\to Y$ be a function between sets. The collection of [[fiber|fibers]] of all points $f(x)$ (the collection of which is a subset of $Y$), denoted $$S = \{f^{-1}f(x)\mid x\in X\}$$ gives rise to a [[partition]] #todo of the set $X$.

That is, 
- If $A \in S$, then $A\neq 0$.
- If $A, B \in S$, then either $A=B$ or $A\cap B = \emptyset$
- The union of all $A \in S$ is $X$. 
## Proof
- By definition, $x\in f^{-1}f(x)$.
