## Theorem
Let $\rho:G\to GL(V)$ be a [[continuous]] [[group representation|representation]] of $G$ into a complex [[vector space]] $V$. Then it is [[complete reducibility|completely reducible]].

## Proof
This follows from the fact that [[continuous representations are unitary with respect to some basis]] and that [[unitary representations are completely reducible]].
