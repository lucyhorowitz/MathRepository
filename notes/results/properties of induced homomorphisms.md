## Theorem
1. Let $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ be [[topological space|topological spaces]] and let $g:X\to Y$ and $f:Y\to Z$ be [[continuous]] functions. Then the [[continuous functions induce homomorphisms on homology groups|induced homomorphism]] of the composition $fg$ is equal to the composition of the [[continuous functions induce homomorphisms on homology groups|induced homomorphisms]]: $$(fg)_* = f_*g_*$$
2. The [[continuous functions induce homomorphisms on homology groups|induced homomorphism]] of the [[identity function]] on a [[topological space]] $X$ is itself.
