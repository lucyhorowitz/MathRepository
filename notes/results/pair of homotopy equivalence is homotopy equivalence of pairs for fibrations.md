## Theorem
Let $A$, $B$, $D$, and $E$ be [[topological space|topological spaces]] so that the following [[commutative diagram|diagram commutes]]:

where $o$and $q$ are [[fibration|fibrations]] and $d$ and $f$ are [[homotopy equivalence of spaces|homotopy equivalences]]. Then $(f,d):p \to q$ is a [[category of spaces over B|fiber homotopy equivalence]].

That is, there are [[homotopy]] inverses of $e$ of $d$ and $g$ of $f$ such that $p\circ g=e\circ q$ with [[homotopy|homotopies]] $H:g\circ f\simeq \text{id}$ and $K:f\circ g\simeq \text{id}$ that [[fibration|cover]] [[homotopy|homotopies]] $h:e\circ d\simeq\text{id}$ and $k:d\circ e\simeq \text{id}$. 
## Proof
The proof is dual to [[pair of homotopy equivalences is homotopy equivalence of pairs for cofibrations]].
