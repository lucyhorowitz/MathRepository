## Theorem
Let $U\subset\mathbb R^n$ be an [[open|open]] subset and let $f:U\to\mathbb R^m$ be of [[class]] $C^k$ such that for every $x\in U$, the [[differentiable|total derivative]] $Df(x)$ has constant [[rank]] $r$. For every $x \in U$, there exists [[open|open]] [[neighborhood|neighborhoods]] of $0$ $$V\subset\mathbb R^n\text{ and } W \subset \mathbb R^m$$ and $C^k$-[[embedding|embeddings]] $\phi:V\to U$ and $\psi:W\to\mathbb R^m$ such that
1. $\phi(0)=x$, 
2. $\psi(0) = f(x)$, 
3. $f(\phi(V))\subset \psi(W)$, and
4. $\psi^{-1}\circ f\circ\phi(x_1,\dots, x_m) = (x_1,\dots,x_r, 0,0)$.
