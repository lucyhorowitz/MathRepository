## Theorem
Let $R$ be a [[ring]] and let $M$ be an $R$-[[module over a ring|module]]. A subset $\{m_i\}_{i=1}^n\subseteq M$ is [[linearly independent]] if and only if the [[module homomorphism|homomorphism]] from the $n$th [[direct sum of modules|direct sum]] $R^{\oplus n}$ of $R$ to $M$ given by $e_i \mapsto m_i$ is [[injective]].
