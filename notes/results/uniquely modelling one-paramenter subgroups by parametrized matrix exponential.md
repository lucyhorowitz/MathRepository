## Theorem 
Let $A(\cdot)$ be a [[one-parameter subgroup]] of the [[general linear group]] $\text{GL}(n,\mathbb C)$. Then there exists a unique $n\times n$ complex [[matrix]] $X$ such that $A(t) = e^{tX}$, the [[exponential of linear transformation|matrix exponential]] of $t$ times $X$. 
## Proof
#write_proof 
[[unique square root of matrices in exponential of at-most-ln2 neighborhood]] [[continuous]] [[matrix logarithm]] [[parametrized matrix exponential is smooth]]
