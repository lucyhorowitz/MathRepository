## Theorem
Let $R$ be a [[ring]] and let $M$ be an $R$-[[module over a ring|module]]. Then the following are equivalent:
- $M$ is a [[Noetherian module]];
- Every nonempty set of [[submodule|submodules]] of $M$ contains a maximal element under inclusion;
- Every [[submodule]] of $M$ is [[finitely generated R-module|finitely generated]].
