## Theorem
Let $X$ be a nonempty [[complete metric space]] and let $\Lambda$ be a [[topological space]], and let $f_\lambda: X\to X$ for $\lambda \in \Lambda$ be a family of [[contraction mapping|contraction mappings]] such that for each $x \in X$, the function $ev_x:\Lambda\to X$ giv en by $ev_x(\lambda) = f_\lambda(x)$ is [[continuous]]. Then the function $\phi: \Lambda\to X$ given by $\phi(\lambda) = x_\lambda$ (where $x_\lambda$ is the [[Banach fixed point theorem|fixed point]] of $f_\lambda$) is [[continuous]].
