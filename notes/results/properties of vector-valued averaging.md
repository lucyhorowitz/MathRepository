## Theorem
Let $G$ be a [[compact]] [[topological group]] and let $\int_G$ be an [[G-invariant function|invariant]] [[vector-valued integral]]. Let $\rho$ be a [[continuous group representation]] into the [[vector space]] $V$. Then 
- The [[averaging of vector-valued function|averaging]] $\text{Av}_{\rho}:V\to V$ is a [[projection]] onto the [[G-invariant vectors]] $V^G$ and we can write $V = V^G \oplus \text{ker}(\text{Av}_\rho)$, or $V$ as the [[direct sum of vector spaces|direct sum]] of $V^G$ and the [[kernel]] of the averaging map.
- $\text{Av}_\rho$ is an [[morphism of group representations|intertwiner]] of $\rho$ with itself. That is, for all $h\in G$, the [[linear transformation|operators]] $\rho(h)$ and $\text{Av}_\rho$ [[commute]].
- Let $\rho':G\to GL(V')$ be another [[continuous group representation]] and let $F:V\to V'$. Then $F\circ \text{Av}_\rho = \text{Av}_{\rho}' \circ F$. There is an associated [[commutative diagram]].
