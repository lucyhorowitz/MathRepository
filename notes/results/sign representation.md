The [[symmetric group]] [[group action|acts]] on $\mathbb R^n$ by permutation of coordinates, and this action defines a [[group homomorphism]] $\rho:S_n \to GL_n(\mathbb R)$. For any [[transposition]] $s_{ij} \in S_n$, the [[determinant]] is $\det(\rho(s_{ij})) = -1$ as the [[sign of permutation|sign]] of any [[transposition]]  [[sign of transposition is -1|is]] $-1$. It follows from the fact that $S_n$ [[permutations are compositions of transpositions|is generated by transpositions]] and the [[determinant is multiplicative|multiplicative]] property of the [[determinant]] that $\det(\rho(s)) = \pm 1$ for any $s\in S_n$. Then the assignment $s\mapsto \det(\rho(s))$ is a [[group homomorphism]] $S_n \to GL_1(\mathbb R) = \mathbb R^\times$, i.e. a one-[[dimension of group representation|dimensional]] [[group representation|representation]] of $S_n$. This representation is called the **sign representation**.
