## Theorem
If $T:V\to W$ is a [[linear transformation]] with [[closed]] [[image]] $\text{im}(T)$ and [[kernel of linear transformation|kernel]] $\text{ker}(T)$, then the [[orthogonal complement]] of the [[kernel of linear transformation|kernel]] of the [[adjoint of a linear transformation|adjiont]] $T^*$ is equal to the [[image]] $\text{im}(T)$ and vice versa. That is,
$$\text{im}(T) = (\text{ker}(T^*))^\perp \text{ and }\text{im}(T^*) = (\text{ker}(T))^\perp.$$
