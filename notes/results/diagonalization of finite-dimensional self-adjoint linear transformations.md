## Theorem
If $T:V\to V$ is a [[linear transformation]] from the finite-[[dimension of vector space|dimensional]] [[vector space]] $V$ to itself, the $T$ is [[self-adjoint]] if and only if there exists an [[orthonormal basis]] of $V$ $\{e_i\}_{i=1}^n \subset V$ consisting of [[eigenvector|eigenvectors]] for $T$.
