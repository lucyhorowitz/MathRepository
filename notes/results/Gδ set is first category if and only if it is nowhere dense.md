## Theorem
In every [[complete metric space]], a [[Gδ]] set is of [[meager|first category]] if and only if it is [[nowhere dense]].
## Proof
Clearly, if any set is [[nowhere dense]], it is automatically of [[meager|first category]]. 

Suppose that $G$ is both [[meager|first category]] and [[Gδ]] in the [[complete metric space|complete]] (and [[Baire category theorem|therefore]] [[Baire space]]) [[metric space]] $X$, but not [[nowhere dense]] in $X$. [[De Morgan's laws|Then]] its complement $X\setminus G$ is [[Fσ]], so we can write $X\setminus G = \bigcup\limits_{n\in\mathbb N} F_n$ for closed $F_n$. Let $U \subset X$ be some nonempty [[open]] set. If $X\setminus G$ contains no [[open]] subset of $U$, then $(X\setminus G) \cap U$ will be an [[Fσ]] set in $U$ with empty [[interior]]. The set $U$ is itself a [[Baire space]], so because an [[Fσ set is first category if and only if it has empty interior]], we know that $(X\setminus G)\cap U$ must be of [[meager|first category]] in $U$. Moreover, $G\cap U$ is itself [[meager|first category]] because $G$ is of [[meager|first category]], and is [[subspace topology|therefore]] of [[meager|first category]] in $U\subset X$. We then have that $U$ is of [[meager|first category]] in itself, so that $U = \bigcup\limits_{n\in\mathbb N} A_n$ for $A_n \cap U$ [[nowhere dense]] in $U$ and $X$. But this makes $U$ [[meager|first category]] in $X$, which is a contradiction because $X$ is [[Baire space|Baire]] and $U$ is [[open]]. Thus $G$ must be [[nowhere dense]].
