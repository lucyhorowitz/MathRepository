## Theorem
Every [[self-adjoint]], [[positive definite]] [[matrix]] can be written uniquely as the [[exponential of linear transformation|matrix exponential]] $e^X$ for $X$ a [[self-adjoint]] [[matrix]]. 

Conversely, the [[exponential of linear transformation|matrix exponential]] $e^X$ of a [[self-adjoint]] [[matrix]] $X$ is also [[self-adjoint]] and it is [[positive definite]].
