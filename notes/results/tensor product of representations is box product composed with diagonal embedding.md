## Theorem

Let $G$ be a [[compact]] [[topological group]] and let $\rho:G\to GL(V)$ and $\rho':G\to GL(V')$ be two [[continuous group representation|continuous]] [[group representation|representations]] of $G$. Then the [[tensor product of group representations|tensor product]] of $\rho$ and $\rho'$ is given by the composition of the [[box product of representations|box product]] $\rho\boxtimes \rho'$ and the diagonal embedding $G\hookrightarrow G\times G$. That is, $$\rho\otimes \rho' : G\hookrightarrow G\times G \to GL(V\otimes V')$$ where the last arrow is $\rho\boxtimes \rho'$.
