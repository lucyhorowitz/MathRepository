## Theorem
Let $p:\mathcal E\to \mathcal B$ be a [[covering of groupoids]] and choose objects $b\in \mathcal B$ and $e\in F_b$. Let $G = \pi(\mathcal B,b)$ and $H = p(\pi(\mathcal E,e))$ as defined in the [[star of an object|star]]. Then the [[group of automorphisms of a cover|group of automorphisms]] $\text{Aut}(\mathcal E)$ is [[group homomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[automorphism group|group of]] [[equivariant map|G-automorphisms]] of the [[group action|G-set]] $F_b$ and therefore to the [[Weyl group]] $WH$. 

If $p$ is [[regular covering space|regular]], then $\text{Aut}(\mathcal E)$ is [[group homomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[quotient by normal subgroup|quotient]] $G/H$. 

If $p$ is [[universal covering space|universal]], then $\text{Aut}(\mathcal E)$ is [[group homomorphism|isomorphic]] to $G$ itself.
