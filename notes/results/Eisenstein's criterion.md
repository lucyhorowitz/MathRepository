## Theorem
Let $R$ be an [[integral domain]]. Let $P\in R$ be a [[prime ideal]] and let $f$ be a [[polynomial ring|polynomial]] with coefficients in $R$. Write $f(x) = a_0 + a_1x+\cdots + a_nx^n$ such that $a_0 \in P\setminus P^2$ (where $P^2 = P\cdot P$ under the [[product of ring ideals]]), $a_n \notin P$, and $a_i \in P$ for all $1\leq i\leq n-1$. Then $f$ does not factor as a product of [[polynomial ring|polynomials]] of [[degree of polynomial|degree]] less than that of $f$. 
## Proof
Suppose that $f$ is [[irreducible element of an integral domain|reducible]]. Then $f=ab$ for $a,b\in R$ non-constant (noon-[[unit of a ring|unit]]) by the [[properties of polynomial ring of integral domain]]. Reduce the coefficients of the equation [[quotient ring|modulo]] $P$ and recall that [[quotient in polynomial ring is quotient in original ring]]. Then we can write $x^n = \overline{a(x)b(x)}$ where the bar denotes reduction mod $P$. [[ideal of commutative ring is prime iff quotient is integral domain|Because]] $P$ is a [[prime ideal]], $R/P$ is an [[integral domain]], so the constant terms of $a$ and $b$ are not [[zero divisor]] so they must be in $P$. But then the constant term of $f$ would be an element of $P^2$, a contradiction.
