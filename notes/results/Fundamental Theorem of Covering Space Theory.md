## Theorem
Let $E$, $X$, and $B$ be both [[connected]] and [[locally path-connected]]. Let $p:E\to B$ be a [[covering space]] and $f:X\to B$ be a [[continuous]] function. Choose $x\in X$, let $b = f(x)$, and choose $e\in F_b$ the [[fiber]] over $b$. Then there exists a map $g:X\to E$ such that $g(x) =e$ and $p\circ g =f$ (that is, a [[lift]] of $f$) if and only if $$f_*(\pi_1(X,x))\subset p_*(\pi_1(E,e))$$ in $\pi_1(B,b)$. The inclusion is inclusion of [[subgroup|subgroups]] and the maps $f_*$, $p_*$ are the [[continuous functions induce homomorphisms on homology groups|induced homomorphisms]] on the [[fundamental group]]. When this condition holds, $g$ is unique.
## Proof
If $g$ exists, its properties ( #todo: the one about the [[image]]?) imply that we have the inclusion of [[image of group homomorphism is subgroup of codomain|images]] $\text{im}(f_*)\subset \text{im}(p_*)$, so we assume for the time being that this holds. Consider the [[fundamental groupoid|fundamental groupoids]] of these spaces $\Pi(X)$, $\Pi(E)$, and $\Pi(B)$ and the associated [[covering of groupoids|covering]] $\Pi(p):\Pi(E)\to \Pi(X)$. The [[Fundamental Theorem of Covering Groupoid Theory]] gives a [[functor]] $\Pi(X)\to \Pi(E)$ that restricts on objects to the unique map $g:X\to E$ of *sets* such that $g(x) =e$ and $p\circ g=f$. We now just need to check that $g$ is [[continuous]], which is true because $p$ as a [[covering space|covering map]] is locally a [[homeomorphism]]:

Let $y\in X$ and suppose that$g(y)\in U$ an [[open]] subset of $E$. Then there is a smaller [[open]] [[neighborhood]] $U'$ of $g(y)$ such that $p$ maps [[homeomorphism|homeomorphically]] onto an [[open]] subset $V$ of $B$. If $W$ is any [[path-connected]] [[neighborhood]] of $y$ such that $f(W)\subset V$, then $g(W)\subset U$ by definition of $g$, so $g$ is [[continuous]].
