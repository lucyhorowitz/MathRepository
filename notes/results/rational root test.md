## Theorem
Let $R$ be a [[unique factorization domain]] and $D^{-1}R$ its [[fraction ring|field of fractions]]. If a [[polynomial ring|polynomial]] $f(x) = a_nx^n+\cdots + a_0 \in R[x]$ has a root in $D^{-1}R[x]$, then we may write it as $\frac{r}{s}$ such that [[greatest common divisor|gcd]]$(r,s)=1$. Then $r$ [[division in a ring|divides]] $a_0$ and $s$  [[division in a ring|divides]] $a_n$. 
## Proof
#write_proof [[Gauss' lemma]] [[linear polynomial divides polynomial iff its solution is a root]]
