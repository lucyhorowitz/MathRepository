Let $G$ be a group. The following are steps to find nontrivial proper [[normal subgroup|normal]] [[subgroup|subgroups]] of $G$.
1. Using the [[center of a group|center]]:
	1. If $G$ is a nontrivial [[p-group]], then its [[center of a group|center]] is nontrivial. 
	2. If the [[center of a group]] is the [[group]] itself, then the [[group]] is [[abelian]] and [[every subgroup of an abelian group is normal]].
2. Using the [[Sylow theorems]]:
	1. If the [[order of a group|order]] of $G$ is such that $|G| = p^km$ for prime $p$ that does not divide $m$, then the facts that $n_p \equiv 1\pmod p$ and $n_p\mid m$ together imply that there is one [[Sylow p-subgroup|p-Sylow subgroup]] of $G$, and [[unique p-Sylow subgroups are normal|therefore]] it is normal.
3. If $G$ has a [[subgroup]] of [[index of a subgroup|index]] $m>1$ and $|G|$  does not divide $m!$, then the [[group homomorphism|homomorphism]] $\rho:G\to S_{G/H}$ that gives the [[group action|action]] of $G$ on $G/H$ is not [[injective]] by [[Lagrange's theorem]], so the [[kernel]], which [[kernel is normal subgroup|is a normal subgroup]], is nontrivial.
4. [[finite group with cyclic smallest prime p-Sylow subgroups have index p normal subgroup]]
