## Theorem
Let $V$ and $W$ be [[definitions/vector space|vector spaces]] and let $V^*$ be the [[dual space|dual]] of $V$. Let $r$ be the smallest integer such that $T\in V^*\otimes W$ [[tensor product of vector spaces|]]can be expressed as a sum of [[pure tensor|pure tensors]] in $V^*\otimes W$. Then $r$ is the [[rank]] of the [[linear transformation]] given by this [[isomorphism between tensor product of dual space and new vector space and maps from vector space to new vector space|isomorphism]].
