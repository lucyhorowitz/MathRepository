## Theorem
Let $\phi:L\to L'$ be a [[Lie algebra homomorphism|homomorphism]] of [[Lie algebra|Lie algebras]] $L$ and $L'$. Then its [[kernel of Lie algebra homomorphism|kernel]] $\text{Ker}(\phi)$ is an [[ideal of a Lie algebra|ideal]] of $L$. 
## Proof
If $x\in \text{Ker}( \phi)$, then $\phi(x) = 0$. For all $y \in L$, this implies that $[x,y] =0$ and $[\phi(x),\phi(y)] = 0$ so that $\phi([x,y]) = [\phi(x),\phi(y)]$. Thus $\text{Ker}(\phi)$ is an [[ideal of a Lie algebra|ideal]].
