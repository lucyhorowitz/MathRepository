## Theorem (for finite collections)
Let $\{B(x_i,r_i)\}_{i=1}^n$ be a collection of balls in a [[metric space]] $X$. Then there exists a subcollection $\{B(x_{j_k},r_{j_k})\}_{k=1}^m$ of disjoint balls such that $$\bigcup_{i=1}^n B(x_i,r_i) \subseteq \bigcup_{k=1}^m B(x_{j_k},3r_{j_k}).$$ These are the "three-times-bigger" balls

## Theorem (for infinite collections)
Let $\{B_i(x_i,r_i)\}_{i\in I}$ be a collection of balls in a [[metric space]] $X$ such that the [[supremum]] $\sup\limits_{i\in I}r_i < \infty$. Then there exists a countable subset $J \subset I$ that gives rise to a countable subcollection $\{B(x_{j},r_{j})\}_{j \in J}$ of disjoint balls from the original collection such that $$\bigcup_{i\in I} B(x_i,r_i) \subseteq \bigcup_{j\in J} B(x_j, 5r_i).$$ These are the "five-times-bigger" balls
