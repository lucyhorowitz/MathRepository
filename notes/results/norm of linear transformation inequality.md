## Theorem
Let $T:V\to W$ be a [[linear transformation]]. Then the [[norm of a linear transformation|norm]] of $T$ satisfies the following inequality: $$||T(x)|| \leq ||T||\cdot ||x||$$ for all $x \in V$.
## Proof
This follows immediately from the definition of the [[norm of a linear transformation|norm]] as a [[supremum]].
