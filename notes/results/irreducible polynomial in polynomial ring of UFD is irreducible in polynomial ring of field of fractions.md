## Theorem
Let $R$ be a [[unique factorization domain]], let $F$ be its [[fraction ring|field of fractions]], and let $p\in R[x]$ be a [[polynomial ring|polynomial]] in $R$ such that the [[greatest common divisor]] of the coefficients is $1$. Then $p$ is [[irreducible element of an integral domain|irreducible]] in $R[x]$ if and only if it is irreducible in $F[x]$.
## Proof
By [[Gauss' lemma]], the first direction follows. The assumption on the [[greatest common divisor]] implies that if $p$ is [[irreducible element of an integral domain|reducible]] in $R[x]$, then $p=ab$ for $a,b$ not constant in $R[x]$. Non-constancy comes from the [[properties of polynomial ring of integral domain]] and the fact that a [[unique factorization domain]] is an [[integral domain]] by definition. We can factor the same way in $F[x]$.
