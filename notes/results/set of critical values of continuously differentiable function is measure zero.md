## Theorem
Let $U\subset\mathbb R^n$ be an [[open]] set and let $f:U\to\mathbb R^n$ be of [[class]] $C^1$.  The set of [[critical value|critical values]] of $f$ has [[measure zero]].
## Proof
#write_proof  [[countable union of measure zero sets has measure zero]] [[composition preserves class]] [[continuous functions on compact sets are uniformly continuous]]
