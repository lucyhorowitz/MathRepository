## Theorem
The function $$\ln(z) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^{n+1}\frac{(z-1)^n}{n}$$ is defined and is [[analytic]] on the complex disk of radius 1 about $z=1$ and moreover for all $z\in \mathbb C$ such that $|z-1|< 1$, $e^{\ln(z)} = z$. For all $u \in \mathbb C$ such that $|u| < \ln(2)$, $|e^u-1| <1$ and $\ln(e^u)=u$.
