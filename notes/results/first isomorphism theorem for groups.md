## Theorem
Let $f: G\to H$ be a [[group homomorphism]]. Then the [[definitions/kernel of group homomorphism|kernel]] $K$ of $\phi$ is a [[normal subgroup]] of $G$, and the [[quotient by normal subgroup|quotient]] $G/K$ is [[group homomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[image]] of $G$.
## Proof
#write_proof [[group]] [[image of group homomorphism is subgroup of codomain]] [[kernel of group homorphism is subgroup of domain]] [[factorization of functions]]
