## Theorem 
Let $R$ be a [[unique factorization domain]] and let $x= up_1^{e^1}\cdots p_n^{e_n}$ and $y = u'p_1^{f_1}\cdots p_n^{e_n}$ for $e_i,f_i\in\mathbb N$ and $u,u'$ [[unit of a ring|units]]. Then the [[greatest common divisor]] of $x$ and $y$ exists and is equal to $$\gcd(x,y) = vp_1^{\max(e_1,f_1)}\cdots p_n^{\max(e_n,f_n)}.$$
## Proof
