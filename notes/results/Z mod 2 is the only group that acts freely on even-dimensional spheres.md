## Theorem
$\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z$ is the only [[group]] that [[free group action|acts freely]] on even-[[dimension of vector space|dimensional]] spheres.
## Proof
#write_proof [[degree of map between spheres|degree]][[homeomorphism]][[homomorphism]][[degree of composition of maps between spheres is product of degree of maps]][[kernel of group homomorphism]]
