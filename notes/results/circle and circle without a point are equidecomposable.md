## Theorem
Let $C$ be a circle in $\mathbb R^2$ and let $x \in C$. Then $C$ and $C\setminus \{x\}$ are [[equidecomposable]].
## Proof
Let $\alpha$ be an angle such that $2\pi\alpha$ is irrational, and let $\alpha^kx$ denote the [[image]] of $x$ after rotation $k$ times by $\alpha$. Then let $M =\{\alpha^nx\}_{n=0}^\infty$. We may write $C = M\cup (C\setminus M)$ and also $C\setminus \{x\} = \alpha M \cup(C\setminus M)$ because there is no integer $k$ for which $\alpha^n = 2\pi$, so we have $\alpha M = M \setminus \{x\}$. Clearly $M$ and $\alpha M$ are [[isometry|isometric]], and $C\setminus M$ is obviously isomorphic to itself. Because these unions are all disjoint, $C$ and $C\setminus \{x\}$ are [[equidecomposable]].
