## Theorem
Let $E$, $A$, and $B$ be [[compactly generated]] [[topological space|topological spaces]]. Let $p:E\to B$ and $g:A\to B$ be any map. Then the induced map $A\times_g E\to A$ is a [[fibration]].
## Proof
This proof is exactly [[dual]] to the proof that [[pushouts of cofibrations are cofibrations]].
