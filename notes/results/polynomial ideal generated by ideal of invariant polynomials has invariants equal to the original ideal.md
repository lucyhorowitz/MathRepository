## Theorem
Let $G$ be a [[compact]] [[subgroup]] [[subgroups of general linear groups are topological groups|of]] the [[general linear group]] $GL_n(\mathbb C)$ and let $J$ be an [[ring ideal|ideal]] of the [[invariant polynomials under group action|algebra of invariant polynomials]] $P^G$. Then for $P = \mathbb C[x_1,\dots,x_n]$, $$P\cdot J = \{f_1\cdot b_1 + \cdots + f_m\cdot b_m \mid m \geq 1, f_i\in P, b_i \in J\}$$ is the [[ring ideal|ideal]] of $P$ [[generate a ring ideal|generated]] by $J$. Then
1. The collection of [[G-invariant vectors|invariants]] $(P\cdot J)^G$ is just $J$ itself. That is, $f\in P\cdot J$ is $G$-[[G-invariant vectors|invariant]] if and only if $f\in J$.
2. A collection $\{b_1,\dots,b_m\}$ [[generate a ring ideal|generates]] $P\cdot J$ as an [[ring ideal|ideal]] of $P$ if and only if they generate $J$ as an [[ring ideal|ideal]] of $P^G$. 
## Proof
1. Clearly $J\subseteq (P\cdot J)^G$. We now show the opposite inclusion. Let $f\in P\cdot J$ be $G$-[[G-invariant vectors|invariant]]. Then there exist $\{b_i\}_{i=1}^m$ in $J$ and $\{f_i\}_{i=1}^m$ in $P$ such that $f = f_1b_1+\cdots + f_mb_m$. The [[averaging of vector-valued function|averaging]] operator applied to both sides yields, noting that $f \in P^G$, because [[averaging map is linear with respect to invariant polynomials]], $$f = \text{Av}(f) + \text{Av}(f_1b_1+\cdots+ f_mb_m) = \text{Av}(f_1b_1) + \cdots + \text{Av}(f_mb_m)$$$$= \text{Av}(f_1)\cdot b + \cdots + \text{Av}(f_m)\cdot b_m.$$ Because [[properties of vector-valued averaging|Av is a projection]] onto $P^G$, for each $i$, $\text{Av}(f_i) \in P^G$. By assumption, $b_i\in J$. Thus $\text{Av}(f_1)\cdot b + \cdots + \text{Av}(f_m)\cdot b_m \in J$ because $J$ is an [[ring ideal|ideal]].

2. By definition we know one direction, i.e. that if $\{b_i\}_{i=1}^m$ generate $J$ then they generate $P\cdot J$. So now assume that $\{b_i\}_{i=1}^m$ generate $P\cdot J$. Then we want to find $c_1,\dots, c_m \in P$ such that $f = c_1b_1+\cdots + c_mb_m$. Note that because $f\in J\subseteq P\cdot J$ and the $b_i$ generate $P\cdot J$, we can find $\{f_i\}_{i=1}^m$ such that $f = f_1b_1 + \cdots + f_m b_m$.Then because all elements of $J$ are by hypothesis $G$-[[G-invariant vectors|invariant]], we can use the same logic as in part (1) to show that $f = \text{Av}(f_1)\cdot b + \cdots + \text{Av}(f_m)\cdot b_m$, and set $c_i = \text{Av}(f_i)$.
