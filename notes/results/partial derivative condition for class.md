## Theorem
Let $U\subset\mathbb R^n$ be an [[open]] subset and let $f:U\to\mathbb R^m$. Then $f$ is of [[class]] $C^k$ if and only if for every [[symmetric group|permutation]] $\sigma \in S_n$, the iterated [[partial derivative]] $$\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{\sigma(k)}}\cdots \frac{\partial}{\partial x_{\sigma(1)}}f$$ exists and is [[continuous]].
