## Theorem
Let $(V_1,\rho_1)$ and $(V_2,\rho_2)$ be [[group representation|representations]] of the finite [[group]] $G$. Then the [[character of a representation|character]] of the [[tensor product of group representations|tensor product]] $V_1\otimes V_2$ is equal to the (pointwise) product of the [[character of a representation|characters]] of $V_1$ and $V_2$.  That is, $$\chi_{V_1\otimes V_2} = \chi_{V_1}\cdot\chi_{V_2}.$$
