## Theorem
Let $B$ be a [[connected graph|connected]] [[graph]] with vertex set $B^0$. Let $p:E\to B$ be a [[covering space]] of $B$. Then $E$ is a [[connected graph|connected]] [[graph]] with vertex set $E^0 = p^{-1}(B^0)$ and one edge for each edge $j$ of $B$ and point $e\in F_{j(0)}$. Thus if $B$ is finite and $p$ is a finite [[covering space|cover]] whose [[fiber|fibers]] have [[cardinal number]] $n$, then $E$ is finite and has [[Euler characteristic of a graph|Euler characteristic]] $\chi(E) =n\chi(B)$. 
## Proof
Think of an edge $j$ of $B$ as a [[path]] $I\to B$ and let $k(e) :I\to E$ be the [[unique lifting property|unique]] [[path]] such that $p\circ k=j$ and $k(e)(0)=e$ where $e\in F_{j(0)}$. We will show that $E$ is a [[graph]] with vertext set $E^0$ and the $k(e)$ as edges. By the [[path lifting property]], each point of $E\setminus E^0$ is an [[interior]] point of exactly one edge, so there is a [[continuous]] [[bijective|bijection]] from the graph $$E\amalg(K\times I)/(\sim)$$ where $K$ is the evident set ( #todo:  what?) of attaching maps $S^0\to E^0$ for the specified edges. This map is a [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] because it is a [[local homeomorphism]] over $B$.
