## Theorem
Any [[subgroup]] of the [[general linear group]] is a [[topological group]].
## Proof
First, recall that the [[general linear group]] [[general linear group is a topological group|is]] itself a topological group. Then any [[subgroup]] inherits the [[subspace topology]] and [[continuous]] functions are still [[continuous]] on any restriction of their domain.
