## Theorem
The set of [[unit of a ring|units]] of [[p-adic field|Qp]] is [[ring homomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[direct product of rings|product]] of the integers and the set of [[unit of a ring|units]] of the [[p-adic integers]]. That is, $$\mathbb Q_p^\times\cong \mathbb Z\times \mathbb Z_p^\times.$$

Equivalently, $$\mathbb Q_p^\times \cong \coprod_{n\in\mathbb Z} p^n\mathbb Z_p^\times$$
## Proof
