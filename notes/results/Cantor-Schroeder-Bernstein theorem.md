## Theorem (functions)
Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. If there exist [[injective]] functions $f:A\to B$ and $g:B\to A$, then there exists a [[bijective|bijection]] $h:A\to B$. 

## Theorem ([[cardinal number|cardinals]])
Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. Then if $|A| \leq |B|$ and $|B|\leq |A|$, then $|A| = |B|$.
