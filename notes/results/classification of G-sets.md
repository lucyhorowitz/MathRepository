## Theorem
Let $G$ be a [[group]] [[group action|acting]] on the set $X$. Then $X$ is [[equivariant map|G-isomorphic]] to a disjoint union of [[quotient by subgroup|quotients]] of $G$ by [[subgroup|subgroups]] of $G$. That is, there exists a [[equivariant map|G-isomorphism]] $$f: X\to \coprod_{i\in I} G/H_i.$$ Moreover, two [[group action|G-sets]] $\coprod_{i\in I} G/H_i$ and $\coprod_{j\in J} G/H'_j$ are [[equivariant map|isomorphic]] as [[group action|G-sets]] if and only if there exists a [[bijective|bijection]] $\sigma: I\to J$ such that $H_i$ is [[conjugate subgroups|conjugate]] to $H'_{\sigma(i)}$ for every $i\in I$. 
## Proof
Every [[group action|G-set]] $X$ [[orbits partition set|is the disjoint union]] of its [[orbit|orbits]], and by the [[factoring lemma]], every [[orbit]] is [[equivariant map|isomorphic]] to some [[quotient by subgroup|quotient]] $G/H$. Thus the first part of the theorem is proved.
