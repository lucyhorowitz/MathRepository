## Theorem
Let $p$ be a prime number and let $G$ be a [[group]] of order $p^n$. Then $G$ has an increasing chain of [[normal subgroup|normal]] [[subgroup|subgroups]] $$\{e\} = K_0 \subset K_1\subset\cdots\subset K_{n-1}\subset K_n = G$$ such that for all $i$, the [[order of a group|order]] of $K_i$ is $p^i$. 
## Proof
Let $M$ be a nontrivial [[p-group]]. [[center of nontrivial p-group is nontrivial|Then]] $M$ has nontrivial #write_proof
