## Theorem
Let $G$ be a [[group]] that has a [[Sylow p-subgroup|p-Sylow subgroup]]. Then every [[subgroup]] $H$ of $G$ also has a [[Sylow p-subgroup|p-Sylow subgroup]].
## Proof
Let $P$ be a [[Sylow p-subgroup|p-Sylow subgroup]] of $G$. Then $G$ [[group action|acts]] on the [[quotient by subgroup|set]] $G/P$. We know that $p$ does not divide the [[cardinal number]] $|G/P|$ by the definition of a [[Sylow p-subgroup|p-Sylow subgroup]]. Let $H$ be a [[subgroup]] of $G$. Then $H$ also [[group action|acts]] on $G/P$, and $G/P$ is [[orbits partition set|therefore]] a disjoint union of $H$-[[orbit|orbits]]. The sizes of these orbits cannot all be divisible by $p$, else the cardinality of the set $G/P$ would be as well. Thus there must exist an $H$-[[orbit]] $Y$ such that $p$ does not divide $|Y|$. By definition, $Y = H(gP)$ for some $h\in H$. By the [[Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem]], $|Y| = |H|/|\text{Stab}_H(gP)|$ where $\text{Stab}_H(gP)$ denotes the [[stabilizer under group action|stabilizer]] of $gP$ under the [[group action|action]] of $H$. We have that $\text{Stab}_H(gP) = H \cap gPg^{-1}$, so $|\text{Stab}_H(gP)|$ is a power of $p$ which definitely does not divide $|Y|$. Thus $|H\cap gPg^{-1}|$ is a power of $P$ as well, but the [[index of a subgroup|index]] of it in $H$ is not divisible by $p$. Thus it is a [[Sylow p-subgroup|p-Sylow subgroup]] of $H$.
