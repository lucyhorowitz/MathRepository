## Theorem
Let $(X,\Sigma,\mu)$ be a [[measure density]] and let $1 < p < \infty$. Then the [[dual space|dual]] of [[Lp space|L]]$_p(\mu)$ is $L_q(\mu)$ for $\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1$. For the case of $p = 1$, we have $(L_1(\mu))^* = L_\infty(\mu)$, but for $p = \infty$ we do _not_ have $(L_\infty(\mu))^* = L_1(\mu)$.
## Proof
Let $g \in L_q(\mu)$ and define a map $Lg \in (L_p(\mu))^*$ by $$Lg(f) = \int_X fg\text d\mu.$$ By [[Hölder's inequality]], we have that $$|Lg(f)| \leq \int_X |fg|\text d\mu \leq ||g||_p||f||_p.$$ Thus $L$ is a [[bounded function|bounded]] linear operator with $||Lg|| \leq ||g||_q$. In fact, $||g||_q$ is the [[operator norm]] of $Lg$. To show that this is the case, we must find $f \in L_p(\mu)$ such that equality holds. Let $f(x) = \text{sign}(g(x))|g(x)|^{q/p}.$ Clearly $f\in L_p(\mu)$ because $$\int_X |f|^p\text d\mu = \int_X |g|^q\text d\mu< \infty.$$ This also implies that $$||f||_p||g||_q = \left(\int_X |f|^p\text d\mu\right)^{1/p}\left(\int_X |g|^q\right)^{1/q}= \left(\int_X |g|^q\right)^{1/p + 1/q} = \int |g|^q.$$ However, $$\int_X|fg|\text d\mu = \int_X |g|^{q/p +1} =\int_X |g|^q.$$ That is, [[Hölder's inequality]] is actually an equality in this case, so the second inequality in the above inequality is an equality. The first inequality is an equality because $fg = |fg|$. Thus this $f$ satisfies $|Lg(f)| = ||g||_q||f||_p$, so $||Lg|| = ||g||_q$, and consequently $g\mapsto Lg$ is an [[isometry]]. 

It remains to show that $g\mapsto Lg$ is [[surjective]]. Given $L \in (L_p(\mu))^*$, let $\nu$ be the [[absolute continuity of measure|absolutely continuous]] [[measure space|measure]] as in [[characteristic elements of dual of Lp are absolutely continuous measures|this lemma]] and let $g$ be the [[Radon-Nikodym derivative]] of $\nu$. Then $$L\chi_A = \nu(A) = \int_A g\text d\mu = \int_X\chi_Ag\text d\mu.$$ That is, $L(f)=Lg(f)$ when $f$ is a [[characteristic function]], so we just wish to make an extension to all of $L_p(\mu)$. 

First we extend to [[bounded function|bounded functions]]. Let $\varepsilon >0$. If $f$ is bounded, then there exists a [[simple function]] $f_1$ for which $||f-f_1||_p < \varepsilon$ and $||f-f_1||_\infty < \varepsilon$ because the [[simple functions are dense in Lp]] for all $p$. Then from [[Hölder's inequality]] and the fact that $L(f_1) = Lg(f_1)$, $$\begin{align*} |Lf - Lg(f)| &= |L(f-f_1) - Lg(f-f_1)\\ &= \left|L(f-f_1) - \int_X(f-f_1)g\text d\mu\right|\\ &\leq ||L||\cdot ||f-f_1||_p + ||f-f_1||_\infty||g||_1 \\ &< \varepsilon(||L|| + ||g||_1).\end{align*}$$ Thus if $f$ was bounded, arbitrary choice of $\varepsilon$ shows that $L(f) = Lg(f)$. 

Now we show that $g \in L_q(\mu)$. Let $$g_N(x) =\begin{cases}g(x) & |g(x)| \leq N \\ 0 & |g(x)| > N\end{cases}\quad \text{ and } f_N(x) =\text{sign}(g_N(x))\cdot|g_n(x)|^{q/p}.$$ Clearly $f_N \in L_p(\mu)$ because it is [[bounded function|bounded]]. Thus $$|Lf_N| = |Lg(f_N)| = \left| \int_X f_Ng\text d\mu\right| = \int_{\{x\in X \mid |g(x)| \leq N\}}|g(x)|^{p/q+1}\text d\mu = ||g_N||_q^q.$$ However, $$|Lf_N| \leq ||L|| \cdot ||f_N||_p = ||L||\cdot ||g_N||_q^{q/p},$$ so if we combine these two equalities and divide by $||g_N||_q^{q/p}$ we find that $||g_N||_q \leq ||L||$. Sending $N\to \infty$ yields $||g||_q \leq ||L||$, so $g \in L_q(\mu)$. 


Fix $\varepsilon > 0$ and let $f\in L_p(\mu)$ be arbitrary and $f_1$ be a [[simple function]] in $L_p(\mu)$ with $||f-f_1||_p < \varepsilon$, which exists because the [[simple functions are dense in Lp]]. Then because $L(f_1)=Lg(f_1)$ and by [[Hölder's inequality]], we have $$\begin{align*} |Lf-Lg(f)| &= |L(f-f_1) - Lg(f-f_1)| \\ &= \left| L(f-f_1) -\int_X(f-f_1)g\text d\mu\right|\\ &\leq ||L||\cdot||f-f_1||_p + ||f-f_1||_p||g||_q \\ &< \varepsilon(||L|| + ||g||_q). \end{align*}$$ Our arbitrary choice of $\varepsilon$ implies that $L = Lg$, as desired.
