 ## Theorem
 A subset $K$ of a [[complete metric space|complete]] [[metric space]] is **compact** if and only if it is [[sequentially compact]] and if and only if it is [[closed]] and [[totally bounded]]. The latter condition is a generalization of the [[Heine-Borel theorem]] to all [[complete metric space|complete]] [[metric space|metric spaces]].
