## Theorem
Let $G$ be a [[group]] [[group action|acting]] [[transitive group action|transitively]] on a set $S$. Let $G_s$ be the [[stabilizer under group action|isotropy subgroup]] of an element $s\in S$. Then there exists a [[equivariant map|G-isomorphism]] between $S$ and the collection of [[left coset|cosets]] denoted $G/G_s$.
