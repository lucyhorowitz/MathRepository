## Theorem
Let $A$ be a [[ring]] and let $M$ and $N$ be [[simple module|simple]] $A$-[[module over a ring|modules]]. Then any nonzero $A$-[[module homomorphism]] $f:M\to N$ is an [[isomorphism]]. 
## Proof
Since $f\neq 0$, we have that the [[image]] $\text{im}(f)$ [[iimage of module homomorphism is submodule|must be]] a nonzero [[submodule]] of $N$. But since $N$ is [[simple module|simple]], any nonzero [[submodule]] of $N$ is equal to $N$. Thus $f$ is [[surjective]]. Similarly, the [[kernel]] $\text{ker}(f)$ is a [[submodule]] of $M$, but it is not zero since $f$ is not zero. Thus $f$ is [[injective]]. Thus $f$ is an $A$-[[module homomorphism|module isomorphism]].
