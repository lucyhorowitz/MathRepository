## Theorem
If $L$ is a [[solvable Lie algebra|solvable]] [[Lie algebra]], then all of its [[subalgebra|subalgebras]] are also [[solvable Lie algebra|solvable]].
## Proof
If $K$ is a [[subalgebra]] of $L$, then for all elements of the [[derived series of a Lie algebra|derived series]] of both $K$ and $L$, $K^{(i)}\subset L^{(i)}$. Thus if for some $n$, $L^{(n)} = \{0\}$, it must be that $K^{(n)} = \{0\}$.
