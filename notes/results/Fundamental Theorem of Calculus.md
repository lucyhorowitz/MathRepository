## Theorem
Suppose $f: [a,b] \to\mathbb R$ is [[continuous]] on the [[interval]] $[a,b]$. Let $F: [a,b] \to \mathbb R$ be the [[Riemann integrable|integral]] $F(x) = \int_a^x f$. Then $F$ is of [[class]] $C^1$ on $[a,b]$ and $F'(x) = f(x)$ on $[a,b]$.

Equivalently, If $f:[a,b] \to\mathbb R$ is [[continuous]] and $g: [a,b] \to \mathbb R$ is a [[differentiable]] function such that $g'(x)=f(x)$ on $[a,b]$, then $\int_a^b f = g(b) - g(a)$.
