## Theorem
If $S\subset\mathbb R^n$ is a [[bounded]] set and $f: S\to\mathbb R$ is a [[bounded]], [[continuous]] function, then $f$ is [[Riemann integrable]] over $S$ if and only if the set of points $x_0 \in \partial S$ in the [[boundary]] for which $\lim\limits_{x\to x_0} f(x) \neq 0$ is of [[measure zero]].
