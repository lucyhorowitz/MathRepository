## Theorem
Every [[matrix]] $A \in \text{GL}(n,\mathbb C)$ may be [[polar decomposition|decomposed]] [[unique representation of positive definite, self-adjoint matrices as exponential of self-adjoint matrix|uniquely]] as the [[matrix multiplication|product]] of a [[unitary matrix]] $U$ and the [[exponential of linear transformation|exponential]] of a [[self-adjoint]] [[matrix]] $X$ so that $$A = Ue^X.$$ Moreover, these $U$ and $X$ depend [[continuous|continuously]] on $A$.
