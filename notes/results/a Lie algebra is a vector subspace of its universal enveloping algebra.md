## Theorem
Let $\mathfrak g$ be a [[Lie algebra]]. Then the elements of its [[basis]] $\{x_i\}$ are [[linearly independent]], and therefore $\mathfrak g$ is a [[vector subspace]] of the [[universal enveloping algebra]] $\mathcal U(\mathfrak g)$.
## Proof
This follows immediately from the [[Poincar√©-Birkoff-Witt theorem]].
