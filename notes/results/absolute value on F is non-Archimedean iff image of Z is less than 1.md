## Theorem
An [[absolute value]] $|\cdot|$ on a [[field]] $F$ is [[non-Archimedean absolute value|non-Archimedean]] if and only if $|a|\leq 1$ for all $a$ in the [[image]] of the function $e:\mathbb Z\to F$ given by $$e(x) = \begin{cases}\underbrace{1+\cdots + 1}_{n\text{ times}} & x= n> 0 \\-\left(\underbrace{1+\cdots + 1}_{n\text{ times}}\right) & x= n< 0 \\
0 & x=0.
\end{cases}$$ Note that this is the canonical map that makes $\mathbb Z$ [[Z is the initial ring|the]] [[initial object|initial]] [[ring]].
## Proof
Suppose that $|\cdot|$ is [[non-Archimedean absolute value|non-Archimedean]]. Then $|\pm 1| = 1$ by the multiplicative condition in the definition of [[absolute value]]. By the [[non-Archimedean absolute value|ultrametric inequality]], $|a+1|\leq\max\{|a|,|1|\}$.  By [[induction]], we are done. 

Now suppose that we ahve the condition on $A$. We want to show the [[non-Archimedean absolute value|ultrametric inequality]], i.e. that for all $x,y\in F$, |x+y| \leq \max\{|x|,|y|\}$. If $y=0$, we are done. If $y\neq 0$, then $y$ must be a [[unit of a ring|unit]] because $F$ is a [[field]], so the [[non-Archimedean absolute value|ultrametric inequality]] is equivalent to $$\left|\frac{x}{y}+1\right|\leq \max\left\{\left|\frac{x}{y}\right|, |1|\right\}$$ But this is just equivalent to the simpler expression $$|z+1|\leq\max\{|z|,|1|\}$$ for all $z\in F$. Consider $|z+1|^m$ for various $m\in\mathbb N$. Then by the [[binomial theorem]], $$|z+1|^m = \left|\sum_{k=0}^m e\left({m\choose k} \right)x^k\right|\leq \sum_{k=0}^m e\left({m\choose k}\right)|x|^k\leq \sum_{k=0}^m|x|^k$$ by the triangle inequality and by hypothesis, because binomial coefficients are natural numbers. Further, $$\sum_{k=0}^m |x|^k \leq(m+1)\max\{|1|,|x|^m\}$$ because if $|x|>1$, then $|x|^m > |x|^k$ for $k < m$. If $|x|\leq 1$, then $|x|^k \leq 1$ for all $k$. Taking the $m$th root of both sides, we find that $|x+1| \leq (m+1)^{1/m}\max\{|1|,|x|\}$. Since the [[infimum]] over $m\in\mathbb N$ of $(m+1)^{1/m}$ is $1$, we are done.
