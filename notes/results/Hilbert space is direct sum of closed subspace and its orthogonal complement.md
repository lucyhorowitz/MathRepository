## Theorem
Let $(H, \langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle)$ be a [[Hilbert space]] and $W \subset H$ a [[closed]] [[vector subspace|subspace]]. Then $H$ is the [[direct sum of group representations]] of $W$ and its [[orthogonal complement]] $W^\perp$. That is, $$H = W \oplus W^\perp.$$
## Proof
#write_proof [[orthogonal complement of orthogonal complement of closed subspace is subspace]]
