## Theorem
Consider the [[Basic Additive Character]] $\psi$. The [[Lebesgue integral|integral]] of $\psi$  over a power of [[curly P]] with respect to the [[Haar measure on additive Qp]] is either equal to $1/p^n$ or to $0$. In particular, $$\int_{\mathcal P^n} \psi(x)\text dx=\begin{cases}\frac{1}{p^n} & n\geq 0 \\ 0 & n <0.\end{cases}$$
## Proof
For $n\geq 0$, we have that $\mathcal P^n$ is contained in the [[p-adic integers]] $\mathbb Z_p$ which [[conductor of basic additive character is p-adic integers|forms]] the [[conductor of a multiplicative character|conductor]] of $\psi$. Then $\psi$ is identically trivial on $\mathcal P^n$, so we reduce to the fact that the [[measure space|measure]] of $\mathcal P^n$ [[additive Haar measure of power of curly P is p^-n|is]] $p^{-n}$. 

For $n<0$, $\psi$ is necessarily nontrivial on $\mathcal P^n$. Then we know that [[nontrivial character has zero integral under Haar measure]], so we are done.
