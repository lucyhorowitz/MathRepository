## Theorem
If $X$ is a [[complete metric space]], then it is a [[Baire space]].
## Proof
Let $X$ be a [[complete metric space]], and let $\{G_i\}_{i\in\mathbb N}$ be a [[countable]] collection of [[dense]] [[open]] subsets of $X$. We wish to show that the intersection $\bigcap\limits_{i\in\mathbb N} G_i$ is itself [[dense]]. 

Let $W \subset X$ be [[open]]. Because $G_1$, is dense, $U_1\cap W$ is nonempty, and because both $G_1$ and $W$ are [[open]], there [[intersection of open sets is open|exists]] a point $x_1$ and $0 < r_1 <1$ such that the [[closed]] ball $\overline B(x_1,r_1)\subset G_1\cap W$. Since each $U_i$ is [[dense]] and [[open]], by the [[Axiom of Choice]] we can find sequences $\{x_i\}_{i\in\mathbb N}$ and $\{r_i\}_{i\in\mathbb N}$ such that $0 < r_i < \frac{1}{i}$ for all $i$, and $$\overline B(x_i,r_i) \subseteq B(x_{i-1},r_{i-1})\cap G_i.$$ We then have that $x_n \in B(x_m,r_m)$ when $n > m$, so $x_n$ is [[Cauchy sequence|Cauchy]]. Because $X$ is [[complete metric space|complete]], it must [[sequence convergence|converge]] to some $x \in X$. Because [[closed]] sets contain their [[limit point|limit points]], $x \in \overline B_n(x_n, r_n)$ for all $n$. Thus $x \in G_n$ for all $n$, and also $x \in W$. This means that the intersection of $W$ and  $\bigcap\limits_{i\in\mathbb N} G_i$ is nonempty, so $\bigcap\limits_{i\in\mathbb N} G_i$ is [[dense]]. QED.
