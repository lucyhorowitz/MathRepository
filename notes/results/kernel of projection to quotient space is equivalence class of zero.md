## Theorem
Let $V$ be a [[definitions/vector space]] and let $W \subset V$ be a [[vector subspace]] of $V$. Then the [[linear transformation]] $$\pi: V \to V/W$$ given by the projection of $v\in V$ to its [[equivalence class]] in the [[quotient vector space]] $V/W$ has [[kernel of linear transformation|kernel]] $W$.
