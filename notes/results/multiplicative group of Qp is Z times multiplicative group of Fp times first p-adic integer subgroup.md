## Theorem
The multiplicative [[group]] of the [[p-adic field]] (that is, nonzero elements of $\mathbb Q_p$) is [[group homomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[direct product of groups|product]] of $\mathbb Q$, the [[any finite multiplicative subgroup of a field is cyclic|cyclic]] multiplicative [[subgroup]]  of $\mathbb F_p$, and the first [[subgroups of p-adic integer units|subgroup of the]] [[p-adic integers|p-adic integer]] [[unit of a ring|units]].
## Proof
[[multiplicative group of Qp is Z times units of p-adic integers]] [[indices of p-adic integer subgroups]] #write_proof
