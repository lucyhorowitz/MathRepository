## Theorem
If $f:Q\to\mathbb R$ is a constant function such that $f(x) = c$ for all $x \in Q$ a [[rectangle]] in $\mathbb R^n$, then the [[lower sum|lower]] and [[upper sum|upper sums]] of $f$ are proportional to the [[volume]] of $Q$ for any [[partition]] $P$: $$L(f,P) = U(f,P) = c\text{vol}(Q),$$ Moreover, $f$ is [[Riemann integrable]] and with integral $$\int_Q f = c\text{vol}(Q)$$
