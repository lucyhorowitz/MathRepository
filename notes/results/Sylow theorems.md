## Theorems
Let $G$ be a finite [[group]].
1.  For every prime factor $p$ with multiplicity $n$ of the [[order of a group|order]] of $G$, there exists a [[Sylow p-subgroup]] of $G$ of [[order of a group|order]] $p^n$. 
2. For any prime number $p$, all [[Sylow p-subgroup|Sylow p-subgroups]] are [[conjugate subgroups|conjugate]] to each other.
3. Let $p$ be a prime factor with multiplicity $n$ of the [[order of a group|order]] of $G$, and write $|G| = p^nm$. Let $n_p$ be the number of [[Sylow p-subgroup|Sylow p-subgroups]] of $G$. Then 
	- $n_p$ divides $m$, and $m$ is the [[index of a subgroup|index]] of the [[Sylow p-subgroup]] in $G$;
	- $n_p \equiv 1\pmod p$;
	- $n_p = [G:N_G(P)]$ where $P$ is any [[Sylow p-subgroup]] of $G$ and $N_G$ denotes the [[normalizer of a group|normalizer]].
