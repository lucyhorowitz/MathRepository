## Theorem
The [[left coset|left cosets]] of a [[group]] $G$ form a [[partition]] of $G$.
## Proof
Let $H$ be a [[subgroup]] of $G$ and let $a,b\in G$. Suppose that for two distinct [[left coset|cosets]] $aH$ and $bH$, their intersection $aH\cap bH$ is nonempty. Then there exists some $w$ contained in both $aH$ and $bH$. By the [[conditions for coset equality]], $aH = wH = bH$. This is a contradiction, and therefore they must either be disjoint or equal.

Note that no [[left coset]] is empty because there is no empty [[subgroup]].
