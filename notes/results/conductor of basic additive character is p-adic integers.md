## Theorem
The [[conductor of a multiplicative character|conductor]] of the [[Basic Additive Character]] $\psi$ of the [[p-adic field]] $\mathbb Q_p$ is the [[p-adic integers]] $\mathbb Z_p$.
## Proof
The [[p-adic expansion is unique|p-adic expansion]] tail of a p-adic integer $z$ is zero, so by definition the tail $\lambda(z)$ is zero. Then again by definition, $\psi(z) = 1$. The tail of any non-integer p-adic number is nonzero, so by [[injective|injectivity]] of the exponential function, $\psi$ is nontrivial everywhere else on $\mathbb Q_p$.
