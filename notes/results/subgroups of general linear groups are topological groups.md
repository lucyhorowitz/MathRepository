## Theorem
Let $GL(V)$ be the [[general linear group]] of a [[vector space]] $V$ with the [[general linear group is a topological group|usual]] [[topological space|topology]]. Then any [[subgroup]] of $GL(V)$, when considered under the [[subspace topology]], is also a [[topological group]].
## Proof
The restriction of [[continuous]] maps to any [[subgroup]] is still [[continuous]], so the definition is satisfied.
