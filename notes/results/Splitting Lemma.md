## Theorem
Consider the [[short exact sequence]] $$0\to A\to B\to C\to 0$$ of [[abelian]] [[group|groups]] where the second arrow is labeled $i$ and the third is labeled $j$. The following statements are equivalent:
1. There exists a [[group homomorphism|homomorphism]] $p:B\to A$ such that $pi = \text{id}_A$.
2. There exists a [[group homomorphism|homomorphism]] $s:C\to B$ such that $js = \text{id}_C$. 
3. There exists an [[group homomorphism|isomorphism]] $B\approx A\oplus C$ between $B$ and the [[direct sum of groups|direct sum]] of $A$ and $C$ such that the following diagram commutes:

where the bottom two maps are simple "projections."
