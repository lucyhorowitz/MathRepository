## Theorem
Let $Q\subset\mathbb R^n$ be a [[rectangle]] and let $f: Q\to\mathbb R$ be a [[bounded]] function. Then $f$ is [[Riemann integrable]] on $Q$ if and only if for every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\delta >0$ such that when the [[mesh]] of $P$ is less than $\delta$, the difference between the [[upper sum|upper]] and [[lower sum]] is less than $\varepsilon$. That is, $$\forall\varepsilon>0, \exists\delta>0 \text{ s.t. }\text{mesh}(P) < \delta \implies U(f,P) -L(f,P) < \varepsilon.$$
