## Theorem
Let $k$ be a [[field]] and let $f\in k[x]$ be a [[polynomial ring|polynomial]] of [[degree of polynomial|degree]] $d$, Then $f$ has at most $d$ roots in $k$.
 ## Proof
 #write_proof  [[linear polynomial divides polynomial iff its solution is a root]] [[induction]] [[division in a ring|divides]]
