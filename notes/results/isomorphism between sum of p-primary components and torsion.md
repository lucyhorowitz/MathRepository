## Theorem
Let $A$ be an [[abelian]] [[group]] and let $p$ be a prime number. There exists a natural [[group homomorphism|isomorphism]] between the [[direct sum of groups|direct sum]] of the [[p-primary component of an abelian group|p-primary components]] of $A$ and the [[torsion subgroup]] of $A$.
