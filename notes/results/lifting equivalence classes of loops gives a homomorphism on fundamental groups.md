## Theorem
Let $B$ be a [[compactly generated]] [[topological space]]. [[lift|Lifting]] of [[equivalence class|equivalence classes]] of [[loop|loops]] in $B$ specifies a [[group homomorphism|homomorphism]] $\pi_1(B,b)\to \pi_0(\text{Aut}(F_b))$ from the [[fundamental group]] of $B$ to some other [[functor]] $\pi_0$ on the [[automorphism group]] of the [[fiber]] of $b$
## Proof
#write_proof [[fibers of path connected space are homotopy equivalent]]
