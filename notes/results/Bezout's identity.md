## Theorem
Let $R$ be a [[principal ideal domain]]. Then for $a,b\in R$, let $d$ be their [[greatest common divisor]]. Then there exist $x,y\in R$ such that $ax+by=d$.
## Proof
The [[ring ideal|ideal]] $(a,b)$ is [[principal ideal]], and in particular [[two-generator ideal in Euclidean domain is generated by their gcd|is]] [[generate a ring ideal|generated]] by $d$.
