## Theorem
Let $G$ be a finite [[group]] [[group action|acting]] on a set $X$. For all $g\in G$, let $X^g = \{x\in X\mid g\cdot x = x\}$. Then the number of [[orbit|orbits]] of the $G$-[[group action|action]] (denoted $|X/G|$) is related to the [[order of a group|size]] of $G$ and the sizes of the $X^g$ in the following way: $$|X/G| = \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G} |X^g|.$$
