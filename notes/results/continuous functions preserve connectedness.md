## Theorem
Let $f:X\to Y$ be a [[continuous]] map between [[topological space|topological spaces]] $X$ and $Y$. Let $X$ be [[connected]]. Then $f(X)\subset Y$ is [[connected]] as a [[subspace topology|subspace]] of $Y$.
## Proof
Let $X$ be [[connected]] and let $f:X\to Y$ be [[continuous]].
Let $U,V \subset Y$ be disjoint, nonempty, and [[definitions/open]].
Suppose $f(X) = U\cup Y$,
- $X = f^{-1}(U) \cup f^{-1}(V)$.
- $f^{-1}(U)$ and $f^{-1}(V)$ are [[inverse image of disjoint sets is disjoint|disjoint]], nonempty, and [[continuous|open]].
- $X$ is not [[connected]], a contradiction.
