## Theorem
Let $H$ be a [[subgroup]] of a finite-[[dimension of vector space|dimensional]] [[Lie group]] $L$. Let $\mathfrak l$ be the [[Lie correspondence|associated]] [[Lie algebra]] of $L$. Then there exists a unique [[definitions/manifold]] structure on $H$ induced by $L$ such that $H$ is a [[Lie group]] with [[Lie correspondence|associated]] [[Lie algebra]] given by $$\mathfrak h = \{z \in \mathfrak l \mid e^{tz}\in H\text{ } \forall t\in \mathbb R\}.$$
