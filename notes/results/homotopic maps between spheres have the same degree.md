## Theorem
Let $f,g:S^n\to S^n$ be [[continuous]] functions that are [[homotopy|homotopic]]. Then $f$ and $g$ have the same [[degree of map between spheres|degree]].
## Proof
This follows directly from the fact that [[homotopic maps induce the same homomorphism on homology]].

#todo: the converse of this from 4.2
