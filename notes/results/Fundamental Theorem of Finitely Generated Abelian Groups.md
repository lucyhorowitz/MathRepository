## Theorem
Let $G$ be a finitely-[[generating set of a group|generated]] [[abelian]] [[group]]. Then $G$ is [[group homomorphism|isomorphic]] to a [[direct sum of groups|direct sum]] of the form $$\mathbb Z^r \oplus\bigoplus_{i=1}^k \mathbb Z/n_i\mathbb Z$$ for some integers $r, n_i$ such that 
1. $r\geq 0$ and $n_i \geq 2$ for all $j$;
2. $n_{i+1}$ divides $n_i$ for all $1\leq i < k$.
