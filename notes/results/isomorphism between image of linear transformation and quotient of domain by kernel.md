## Theorem (MATH 20800 version)
Let $T: V\to W$ be a [[linear transformation]]. There exists an [[linear transformation|isomorphism]] between the image of $T$ and the [[quotient vector space|quotient]] of $V$ by the [[kernel of Lie algebra homomorphism|kernel]] of $T$ given by $$S: \text{im}(T) \to V/\text{ker}(T), S = \Pi^{-1}(T)$$ where $\Pi$ is [[isomorphism between maps with domain quotient space and domain parent space|this isomorphism]].

## Theorem (Humphreys' version)
Let $\phi: L \to L'$ be a [[Lie algebra homomorphism|homomorphism]] of [[Lie algebra|Lie algebras]] $L$ and $L'$. Then the [[quotient of Lie algebra by ideal|quotient]] of $L$ by the [[kernel of Lie algebra homomorphism|kernel]] of $\phi$, denoted $L/\text{Ker}(\phi)$, is [[Lie algebra homomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[image]] $\text{Im}(\phi)$ of $\phi$.

Moreover, if $I$ is any [[ideal of a Lie algebra|ideal]] of $L$ contained in the [[kernel of Lie algebra homomorphism|kernel]] $\text{Ker}(\phi)$, then there exists a unique [[Lie algebra homomorphism|isomorphism]] $\psi: L/I \to L$  such that the following diagram [[commutative diagram|commutes]] for $\pi$ the [[definitions/canonical map]]:
