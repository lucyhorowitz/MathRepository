## Theorem
An [[exact sequence]] is a [[chain complex]].
## Proof
Denote the [[exact sequence]] by $$\cdots \to A_{n+1}\to A_n \to A_{n-1}\to \cdots$$ where the arrow between $A_{k+1}$ and $A_{k}$ is labelled $\alpha_{k+1}$. By definition, the [[kernel of group homomorphism|kernel]] of one [[group homomorphism|homomorphism]] equals the [[image]] of the previous one, so we trivially have the inclusion $$\text{Im}(\alpha_{n+1})\subset \text{Ker}(\alpha_n)$$ which is equivalent to the composition $$\alpha_{n}\alpha_{n+1}=0,$$ the condition for a [[chain complex]].
