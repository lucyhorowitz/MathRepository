## Theorem
Let $G$ be a [[compact]] [[topological group]] and let $\rho:G\to GL(V)$ be a [[continuous group representation]]. The [[averaging of vector-valued function|averaging]] associated to $\rho$ is a [[projection]] from $V$ onto the [[subspace topology|subspace]] of [[G-invariant vectors]]. Thus $\text{Av}_\rho^2 = \text{Av}_\rho$ and we have the [[direct sum of vector spaces|direct sum decomposition]] $$V = \text{im}(\text{Av}_\rho) \oplus \text{Ker}(\text{Av}_\rho) = V^G \oplus \text{Ker}(\text{Av}_\rho)$$ of $V$ into the [[image]] and [[kernel]] of $\text{Av}_\rho$. 

Moreover, $\text{Av}_\rho$ is an [[morphism of group representations|intertwiner]] of $\rho$ with itself, i.e. it [[commute|commutes]] with the [[group action|action]]. Thus the [[kernel]] above is another [[G-invariant subspace]].

Finally, if $\rho':G\to GL(V')$ is another [[group representation|representation]] and $F:V\to V'$ another [[morphism of group representations|intertwiner]], then the following diagram [[commutative diagram|commutes]]:
