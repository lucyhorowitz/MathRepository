## Theorem 
Let $R$ and $S$ be [[ring|rings]] and let $f:R\to S$ be a [[ring homomorphism|homomorphism]]Then the [[kernel of ring homomorphism|kernel]] of $f$ is an [[ring ideal|ideal]] of $R$, the [[image]] of $f$ is a [[unital subring|subring]] of $S$, and the [[image]] of $f$ is [[ring homomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[quotient ring]] $R/\text{ker}(f)$.

Moreover, if $f$ is [[surjective]], then $S$ is [[ring homomorphism|isomorphic]] to $R/\text{ker}(f)$. 

This theorem is usually represented by the [[commutative diagram]]![[Screen Shot 2022-01-28 at 11.03.56 PM.png]]
