## Theorem
Let $L$ and $H$ be [[Lie group|Lie groups]] with [[Lie correspondence|associated]] [[Lie algebra|Lie algberas]] $\mathfrak l$, $\mathfrak k$ respectively. The[[Lie correspondence|associated]] [[Lie algebra]] of the [[semidirect product]] $L\ltimes H$ is the [[semidirect product]] $\mathfrak l\ltimes \mathfrak k$ with [[group homomorphism]] given by [[differentiable|derivative]] ??
