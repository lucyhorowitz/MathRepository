## Theorem
Let $U \subset \mathbb R^{k+n}$ be [[open]] and let $f:U \to \mathbb R^n$ be a function of [[class]] $C^r$. Write $f$ in the form $f(x,y)$ for $x \in \mathbb R^k$ and $y \in \mathbb R^n$. Suppose that $(a,b)$ is a point of $U$ such that $f(a,b) = 0$ and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(a,b)$ is invertible. Then there is a neighborhood $V$ of $a$ in $\mathbb R^k$ and a unique funciton of [[class]] $C^r$ $g: V \to\mathbb R^n$ such that $g(a) =b$ and $f(x,g(x))=0$ for all $x \in V$.
