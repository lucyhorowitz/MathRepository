## Theorem
Let $R$ be a [[ring]] and let $D = R/\{0\}$ so that we have the [[fraction ring]] $D^{-1}R$. Let $f:R\to S$ be a [[ring homomorphism|homomorphism]] for some [[ring]] $S$. If $f(d)$ is a [[unit of a ring|unit]] of $S$ for every $d\in D$, then there exists a unique [[ring homomorphism|homomorphism]] $\tilde f:D^{-1}R \to S$ such that $$\tilde f\left(\frac{r}{1}\right) = f(r).$$ That is, if we let $\iota$ be the map $R\to D^{-1}R$ defined by $r\mapsto \frac{r}{1}$ (we will have that $\iota(d)$ is a [[unit of a ring|unit]] for all $d\in D$), there is a unique [[ring homomorphism|homomorphism]] $\tilde f$ such that $\tilde f\circ \iota = f$.

This is the [[universal property]] for the [[fraction ring]].
