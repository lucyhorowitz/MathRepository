aliases: derivative of matrix exponential at 0

## Theorem
Let $X \in M_n(\mathbb C)$ be a complex [[matrix]]. Then $e^{tX}$ is a [[smooth]] curve in $M_n(\mathbb C)$ and its [[differentiable|derivative]] with respect to $t$ satisfies $$\frac{\text d}{\text dt}e^{tX} = Xe^{tX}=e^{tX}X.$$ [[properties of the matrix exponential|Evaluating]] at $t=0$ shows that the derivative there is just $X$.
