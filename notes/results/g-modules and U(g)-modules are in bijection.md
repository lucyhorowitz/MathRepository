## Theorem
Let $\mathcal g$ be a finite-[[dimension of vector space|dimensional]] [[Lie algebra]] and let $\mathcal U(\mathfrak g)$ be its [[universal enveloping algebra]]. Then there exists a [[bijective|bijection]] between $\mathfrak g$-[[module over a Lie algebra|modules]] and $\mathcal U(\mathfrak g)$-[[module over a Lie algebra|modules]].
