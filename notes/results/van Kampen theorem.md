### Theorem 
Let $\mathcal O = \{U\}$ be a [[open cover|cover]] of a [[topological space]] $X$ by [[path-connected]] [[open]] subsets such that the intersection of finitely many subsets in $\mathcal O$ is still an element of $\mathcal O$. Then we may think of $\mathcal O$ as a [[category]] whose objects are the sets $U$ and whose morphisms are the inclusions of subsets. Note that the [[fundamental groupoid]], written as a [[functor]] $\Pi$, when restricted to the [[subspace topology|spaces]] and maps in $\mathcal O$, gives an $\mathcal O$-[[D-shaped diagram|shaped diagram]] $$\Pi_{|\mathcal O} :\mathcal O \to \mathcal{GP}$$ of [[groupoid|groupoids]]. The [[fundamental groupoid]] $\Pi(X)$  is the [[colimit of a D-shaped diagram|colimit]] of this diagram. That is, $$\Pi(X) \cong \text{colim}_{U\in \mathcal O}\Pi(U).$$
### Proof
We have to check that the [[colimit of a D-shaped diagram|universal property for colimits]] holds. For a [[groupoid]] $\mathcal C$ and a map $\eta:\Pi_{|\mathcal O}\to\underline{\mathcal C}$ of $\mathcal O$-[[D-shaped diagram|shaped diagrams]] of [[groupoid|groupoids]], we need to consrtruct a map $\tilde\eta:\Pi(X)\to \mathcal C$ that restricts to $\eta_U$ on $\Pi(U)$ for each $U\in\mathcal O$. On objects (points of $X$), this requires that we define $\tilde\eta(x) = \eta_U(x)$ for $x\in U$. Because we have required that $\mathcal O$ is closed under finite intersection, this is independent of a choice of $U$! Nice. 

On morphisms, if a [[path]] $f:x\to y$ lies entirely in a given $U\in\mathcal O$, then we must define $\tilde\eta[f] = \eta([f])$. Even if $f$ is contained in multiple $U$, this definition is still independent of choice of $U$: this is because any [[path]] $f$ is a composite of finitely many [[path|paths]] $f_i$, which we can choose to be contained in a single $U$. Then we have to define $\tilde \eta[f]$ as the composite of the $\tilde\eta[f_i]$. 

Suppose that the [[path|paths]] $f$ and $g$ from $x$ to $y$ are [[homotopy equivalence of paths|homotopy equivalent]] via a [[homotopy]] $h:f\simeq g$. [[partition of a set|Partition]] the [[rectangle|square]] $I\times I$ into subsquares that each map into one of the $U$, choosing the subdivision so that the resulting subdivision of $I\times\{0\}$ is a [[refinement]] of the subdivision we used to write $f$ as a composite of paths $f_i$. Do the same for $g$ as a subdivision of $I\times \{1\}$. Then the relation $[f]=[g]$ in $\Pi(X)$ comes from a finite number of relations, each living in one of the $\Pi(U)$. Thus $\tilde\eta([f]) = \tilde\eta([g])$.
