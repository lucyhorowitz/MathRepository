## Theorem
Let $X$ be a [[path-connected]] [[topological space]]. Then the inclusion $\pi_1(X,x)\to \Pi(X)$ between its [[fundamental group]] and [[fundamental groupoid]] is an [[equivalence of categories]].
## Proof
Consider $\pi_1(X,x)$ as a [[category]] with a single object (i.e. a [[groupoid]]). Then $\pi_1(X)$ [[endomorphisms of groupoid objects form a skeleton|is]] a [[skeleton of a category|skeleton]] of $\Pi(X)$, and the [[inclusion functor on skeleton|inclusion functor]] [[inclusion functor on skeleton is an equivalence of categories|is]] an [[equivalence of categories]].
