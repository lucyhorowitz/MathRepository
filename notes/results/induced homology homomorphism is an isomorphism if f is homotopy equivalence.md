## Theorem
Let $f:X\to Y$ be a [[continuous]] function between [[topological space|topological spaces]] $X$ and $Y$ and let $f_*:H_n(X)\to H_n(Y)$ be the [[continuous functions induce homomorphisms on homology groups|induced homomorphism]] on their [[singular homology group|homology groups]]. Then $f_*$ is an [[group homomorphism|isomorphism]] if $f$ is a [[homotopy equivalence of spaces]].
