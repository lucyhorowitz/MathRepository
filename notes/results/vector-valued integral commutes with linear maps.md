## Theorem
Let $X$ be a [[locally compact]] [[Hausdorff]] [[topological space]]. The [[vector-valued integral]] over $X$ is independent of a choice of [[basis]] for target [[vector space]] $V$, and moreover it commutes with [[linear transformation|linear transformations]]. Formally, if $W$ is a finite-[[dimension of vector space|dimensional]] [[vector space]], then given a [[linear transformation]] $A:V\to W$ then for all $f:X\to V$, the [[vector-valued integral|integral]] of the [[function composition|composite]] $A\circ f$ is integrable with $$\int_X A(f(x))\text dx = A\int_Xf(x) \text dx \in W.$$

This is a generalization of the [[linearity of the integral]] for the [[vector-valued integral]]

## Proof
The proof is largely just computation. We really only used the [[linearity of the integral]].
