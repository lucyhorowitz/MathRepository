## Theorem
Let $G$ be [[group]]. [[action of a group on quotient by subgroup|Then]] $G$ [[group action|acts]] on the [[quotient by subgroup|quotients]] $G/H$ and $G/K$ for [[subgroup|subgroups]] $H$ and $K$ of $G$. A [[equivariant map|G-map]] $\alpha:G/H\to G/K$ is of the form $\alpha(gH) = g\gamma K$ where $\gamma\in G$ is such that $\gamma^{-1}h\gamma \in K$ for all $h\in H$.
## Proof
If $\alpha(eH) = \gamma K$, then $$\gamma K = \alpha(eH) = \alpha(hH) = h\alpha(eH) = h\gamma K$$ implies the result.
