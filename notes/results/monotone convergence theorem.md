## Theorem
Let $(X,\Sigma,\mu)$ be a [[measure space]] and let $E \in \Sigma$. Let $\{f_n\}_{n\in\mathbb N}$ be a  non-decreasing sequence of $(\Sigma, \mathcal B_{\mathbb R_{\geq0}})$-[[measurable function|measurable]] nonnegative functions $f_n: E\to[0, +\infty]$ [[pointwise convergence|converging pointwise]] [[almost everywhere]] to $f$. That is, $0 \leq f_n(x) \leq f_{n+1}(x) \leq \infty$, and $\mathcal B_{\mathbb R_{\geq 0}}$ is the [[Borel Ïƒ-algebra]] on $[0, +\infty]$. Then for every $x\in E$, we have $$f(x) = \lim_{n\to\infty} f_n(x).$$ Then $f$ is $(\Sigma, \mathcal B_{\mathbb R_{\geq0}})$-[[measurable function|measurable]] and the limit of the [[Lebesgue integral]] is such that $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_E f_nd\mu = \int_E fd\mu.$$
## Proof
For all $n$ and all $x$, we have $f_n(x) \leq f(x)$. Thus by [[monotonicity of Lebesgue integral|monotonicity of the integral]], we have $$\int f_nd\mu\leq \int fd\mu$$ for all $n$. Then by definition of [[limit supremum]] and [[limit infimum|infimum]], we also have $$\begin{align*}\limsup_{n\to\infty} \int f_nd\mu &\leq \int fd\mu\\\liminf_{n\to\infty}\int f_nd\mu &\leq \int fd\mu. \end{align*}$$ But by [[Fatou's lemma]], we also have the second inequality: $$\limsup_{n\to\infty} \int f_nd\mu \leq\int fd\mu \leq \liminf_{n\to\infty}\int f_nd\mu.$$ Because whenever the [[limit supremum]] and [[limit infimum|infimum]] both exist, [[limit supremum is greater than or equal to limit infimum|the former is greater than or equal to the latter]], it follows that $$\limsup_{n\to\infty} \int f_nd\mu =\int fd\mu =\liminf_{n\to\infty}\int f_nd\mu.$$ Since the [[limit exists if and only if both limit supremum and infimum exist and are equal]], we then have $$\lim_{n\to\infty} \int f_nd\mu = \int fd\mu.$$
