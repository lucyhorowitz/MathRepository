## Theorem
Let $A$ be an [[algebra over a field|algebra]] over the [[field]] $\mathbb k$ and let $a\in A$. Let $A_a$ be the [[subalgebra]] [[generate an associative algebra|generated]] by $a$. Let $m_a:A\to A$ given by $x\mapsto ax$ be the multiplication map. Note that it is $\mathbb k$-[[linear transformation|linear]]. 
1. The element $a$ is [[algebraic element of an algebra|algebraic]] if and only if the [[algebra over a field|algebra]] $A_a$ is of finite [[dimension of vector space|dimension]] as a [[vector space]] over $\mathbb k$;
2. If $A$ is [[algebraic element of an algebra|algebraic]] then $m_a\in \text{End}_\mathbb k(A)$ is also [[algebraic element of an algebra|algebraic]] in the $\mathbb k$-[[algebra over a field|algebra]] $\text{End}_\mathbb k(A)$ and moreover they have the same [[algebraic element of an algebra|minimal polynomial]];
3. If $a$ is [[algebraic element of an algebra|algebraic]] then its [[spectrum]] consists of the roots in $\mathbb k$ of its [[algebraic element of an algebra|minimal polynomial]] $p_a$.
## Proof
1. By definition, $A$ is finite-[[dimension of vector space|dimensional]] if and only if there exists $n\geq 0$ such that $A_a$ is the $\mathbb k$-[[span]] of the elements $\{a^i\}_{i=0}^n$. If we were to express $a^{n+1}$ as a linear combination of these elements, we would have a monic polynomial $p$ such that $p(a) = 0$, i.e. we would have that $a$ is [[algebraic element of an algebra|algebraic]]. Conversely, if $a$ is [[algebraic element of an algebra|algebraic]] with [[algebraic element of an algebra|minimal polynomial]] of [[degree of polynomial|degree]] $n+1$, then $\dim(A_a) = \dim(\mathbb k[t]/(p_a))= n+1.$ That is, the [[dimension of vector space|dimension]] of $A_a$ is the same as that of the [[quotient ring|quotient]] of the [[polynomial ring]] by the [[ring ideal|ideal]] [[generate a ring ideal|generated]] by $p_a$. 
2. Now note that if $f(a) = 0$ for some $f\in \mathbb k[t]$ (i.e. if $a$ is [[algebraic element of an algebra|algebraic]], then $f(m_a) = m_{f(a)} = 0$ and thus $m_a$ is [[algebraic element of an algebra|algebraic]]. Conversely, if $f(m_a) = 0$, then $f(a) = m_{f(a)}(1_A) = f(m_a)(1_A)= 0$. Thus $f(a) = 0$ if and only if $f(m_a) = 0$, so the result follows.
3. Suppose that $a$ is [[algebraic element of an algebra|algebraic]] and let $\lambda\in \mathbb k$ be a root of $p_a$. Then $p_a$ is [[division in a ring|divisible]] by $(\lambda-t)$, so $p_a(t) = (\lambda-t)q(t)$ for some other [[polynomial ring|polynomial]] $q\in \mathbb k[t]$. Thus $\lambda - a$ is a [[zero divisor]] in $A$, and thus $\lambda- a$ is not invertible so it belongs to the [[spectrum]] $\text{spec}(a)$. Conversely, let $\lambda\in \mathbb k$ be a root of $p_a$ but suppose that $\lambda \notin \text{spec}(a)$. This means that $\lambda -a$ is [[inverse element|invertible]], so the equation $(\lambda-a)q(a) = p_a(a)= 0$ implies that $q(a) = 0$. Thus $q$ belongs to the [[ring ideal|ideal]] [[generate a ring ideal|generated]] by a $p_a$, contradicting [[algebraic element of an algebra|minimality]] of $p_a$.
