## Theorem
Let $(X,\Sigma,\mu)$ be a [[measure space]] and let $\{f_n\}_{n\in\mathbb N}$ be a sequence of functions $f_n: X\to \mathbb R$ such that there exists $g\in L_1(\mu)$ for which $|f_n|\leq g$ for all $n$. Then If $f_n$ [[pointwise convergence|converges pointwise]] to $f$ at [[almost everywhere|almost every]] $x \in X$, $f_n$ [[sequence convergence|converges]] to $f$ in [[Lp space|L]]$_1(\mu)$.
## Proof
This follows immediately from the [[dominated convergence theorem]].
