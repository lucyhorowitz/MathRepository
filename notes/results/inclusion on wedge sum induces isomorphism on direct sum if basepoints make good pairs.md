## Theorem
Let $X_\alpha$ be a collection of [[based topological space|based]] [[topological space|topological spaces]]. Then the inclusions $i_\alpha: X_\alpha \hookrightarrow \bigvee_\alpha X_\alpha$ of the individual $X_\alpha$ into the [[wedge sum]] of all of the $X_\alpha$ induce an [[group homomorphism|isomorphism]] $$\bigoplus_\alpha i_{\alpha *}: \bigoplus_\alpha H_n(X_\alpha) \to \tilde H_n\left(\bigvee_\alpha X_\alpha\right)$$ between the [[direct sum of groups|direct sum]] of the [[homology group|homology groups]] of the $X_\alpha$ and the [[reduced homology group]] of the [[wedge sum]] of the $X_\alpha$ if for each $\alpha$, the [[wedge sum]] is formed at basepoints $x_\alpha$ such that the pair $(X_\alpha,x_\alpha)$ is [[exact sequence on reduced homology of space and retractable subspace|good]].
## Proof
Since [[reduced homology is homology relative to a basepoint]], this follows from the fact that the [[quotient map on good pairs inuces isomorphisms]] by taking the [[exact sequence on reduced homology of space and retractable subspace]] $$(X,A) =  \left(\coprod_\alpha X_\alpha, \coprod_\alpha\{x_\alpha\}\right).$$
