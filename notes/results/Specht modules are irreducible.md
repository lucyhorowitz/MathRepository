## Theorem
Fix $n > 0$ and let $\lambda$ be a [[partition of an integer|partition]] of $n$. Then the [[Specht module]] $V(\lambda)$ is an [[irreducible representation|irreducible]] [[group representation|representation]] of the [[symmetric group]] $S_n$.

Moreover, a [[group representation|representation]] of $S_n$ is irreducible if and only if it is [[morphism of group representations|isomorphic]] to a [[Specht module]] $V(\mu)$ for some [[partition of an integer|partition]] $\mu$ of $n$.
