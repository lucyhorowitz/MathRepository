## Theorem
Let $G$ be a finite [[group]]. Then $G$ is [[nilpotent group|nilpotent]] if and only if all [[Sylow p-subgroup|Sylow p-subgroups]] of $G$ are normal in $G$, or equivalently if $G$ is [[group homomorphism|isomorphic]] to a [[direct sum of groups]] of $p$-groups, each corresponding to a prime factor of the [[order of a group|order]] of $G$.
