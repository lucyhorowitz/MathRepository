## Theorem
Every [[matrix]] $A$ in the real [[special linear group]] $\text{SL}(n,\mathbb R)$ can be written uniquely as the [[matrix multiplication|product]] of $R$ in the [[special orthogonal group]] and the [[exponential of linear transformation|matrix exponential]] of $X$ a real [[self-adjoint]], [[trace|traceless]] [[matrix]]. That is, $$A = Re^X.$$
