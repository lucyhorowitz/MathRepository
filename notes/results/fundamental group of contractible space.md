## Theorem
The [[fundamental group]] of a [[contractible]] [[topological space]] is trivial.
## Proof
The [[fundamental group]] of a point is trivial. By definition, a [[contractible]] space is [[homotopy equivalence of spaces|homotopy equivalent]] to a point. Because [[homomorphisms induced by homotopy equivalence are isomorphisms]], the [[fundamental group]] of a [[contractible]] space must also be trivial.
