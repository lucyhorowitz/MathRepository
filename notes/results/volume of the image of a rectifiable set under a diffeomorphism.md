## Theorem
Let $U,V\subset\mathbb R^n$ be [[open]] sets and $g:U\to V$ a $C^k$ [[diffeomorphism]]. Let $T \subset \mathbb R^n$ be a [[rectifiable]] set whose [[closure]] is contained in $U$ (i.e. $\overline T \subset U$). Then the [[volume of a rectifiable set|volume]] of the image of $T$ under $g$ is equal to the [[Riemann integrable|integral]] of the [[Jacobian determinant]] of $g$ over $T$. That is,
$$\text{vol}(g(T)) = \int_T Jg.$$
