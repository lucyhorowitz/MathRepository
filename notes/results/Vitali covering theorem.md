## Theorem
Let $A\subset \mathbb R^m$ be of finite [[Lebesgue measure]] and let $\mathcal V$ be a collection of balls in $\mathbb R^m$ that form a [[Vitali covering]] of $A$. Then there exists a pairwise disjoint, at-most-countable subcollection $\{U_i\} \subseteq \mathcal V$ such that $$\mu\left(A\setminus \bigcup_i U_i\right) =0.$$ That is, the subcollection covers almost all points in $A$.
## Proof
Without loss of generality, assume that the [[diameter of a set|diamter]] of the sets $U_i$ is bounded above by $1$. We may remove all the sets in the cover with greater [[diameter of a set|diameter]] and still be left with a [[Vitali covering]], and we may also remove all sets in $\mathcal V$ that are disjoint from $A$.

Suppose first that $A$ is [[bounded]], and choose an [[open]] set $G_1\supset A$ such that $\mu(G_1) < \left(1+ \frac{1}{4c^m}\right)\mu(A)$ and remove from $\mathcal V$ the sets not contained in $G_1$ . We use a [[greedy algorithm]] to cover $A$. Choose $U_1 \in \mathcal V$ such that $$\text{diam}(U_1) \geq 0.9\sup\{d \mid d \text{ is the diameter of some } U_i\}.$$ Then choose $U_2 \in \mathcal V$ such that $$\text{diam}(U_2) \geq 0.9 \{d \mid d \text{ is the diameter of some } U_i \text{ disjoint from } U_1\}$$ and so on to choose countably many disjoint sets $U_n$. This collection will cover a fixed portion of $A$. Because $A$ is [[bounded]] and the sets $U_n$ are disjoint, there can be only finitely many balls whose [[diameter of a set|diamter]] is greater than any fixed number, so that $\text{diam}(U_n) \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$. 

Suppose that $x \in A\setminus \bigcup\limits_{n\in\mathbb n} U_n$ and fix some set $U \in\mathcal V$ containing $x$. This set $U$ must intersect one of the $U_n$. Because the diameters of the $U_n$ tend to zero, we have that $$\sup\{d \mid d \text{ is the diameter of some } U\in \mathcal V \text{ disjoint from the } U_n\}\to 0.$$ Thus if $U$ is not in the sequence, it must intersect one of the members of the sequence. Now let $U_i$ be the first set intersecting $U$ and let $d = \text{diam}(U)$. By construction, $d_i \geq 0.9d$. If we multiply $d_i$ by some constant $c$, the set $cU_i$ will cover $U$. Thus multiplying the diameter of each set $U_n$ by $c$ will result in a cover of $A$.  Then $\mu(cU_n) = c^m\mu(U_n)$ by properties of the [[Lebesgue measure]]. Then
$$\mu(A) \leq \mu\left( \bigcup_{n\in\mathbb n} cU_n\right)\leq \sum_{n\in\mathbb N}\mu(cU_n) = \sum_{n\in\mathbb N}c^m\mu(U_n).$$ This implies that $\frac{1}{c^m}\mu(A) \leq \sum\limits_{n\in\mathbb N}\mu(U_n)$. Thus we can choose finitely many balls such that $$\frac{1}{2c^m}\mu(A) \leq \sum_{n=1}^N \mu(U_n) = \mu(U_{1,1}\cup \cdots\cup U_{1,N_1}).$$ Let $A_1 = A\setminus (U_{1,1}\cup \cdots\cup U_{1,N_1})$. Then $$\begin{align*}\mu(A_1)&\leq \mu(G_1 \setminus (U_{1,1}\cup \cdots\cup U_{1,N_1}))\\
&=\mu(G_1) - \mu(U_{1,1}\cup \cdots\cup U_{1,N_1})\\ &\leq \left(1+\frac{1}{4c^m}\right)\mu(A) -\frac{1}{2c^m}\mu(A) \\ &= \mu(A) \left(1-\frac{1}{4c^m}\right).\end{align*}$$ 

Now choose an [[open]] set around $A_1$ whose [[measure space|measure]] is at most $\frac{1}{4c^m}$ greater than $\mu(A_1)$. We can do this by the [[intermediate value theorem for finite measure]]. Intersect it with $G_1 \setminus (\overline{U_{1,1}}\cup \cdots\cup \overline{U_{1,N_1}
})$ to get the [[open]] set $G_2$. Then $\mu(G_2) \leq \left(\frac{1}{4c^m}\right)\mu(A_1)$, and repeat the process above to find a finite collection $U_{2,1},\dots, U_{2,N_2}$ such that $$\frac{1}{2c^m}\mu(A_1) \leq \mu(U_{2,1}\cup \cdots\cup U_{2,N_2}).$$ Then $$\begin{align*}\mu(A_1\setminus (U_{2,1}\cup \cdots\cup U_{2,N_2})) &\leq \mu(G_2\setminus (U_{2,1}\cup \cdots\cup U_{2,N_2}))\\ &= \mu(G_2) -\mu(U_{2,1}\cup \cdots\cup U_{2,N_2})\\ &\leq \left(1+\frac{1}{4c^m}\right)\mu(A_1) -\frac{1}{2c^m}\mu(A_1) \\ &= \left(1-\frac{1}{4c^m}\right)\mu(A_1) \\ &\leq \mu(A)\left(1-\frac{1}{4c^m}\right)^2.\end{align*}$$ Inductively, we have that $$\mu(A_n\setminus U_{n+1,1}\cup \cdots\cup U_{n+1,N_{n+1}}) \leq \mu(A) \left(1-\frac{1}{4c^m}\right)^n$$ Because $0< \frac{1}{4c^m} < 1$, it approaches zero as $n \to \infty$. 

Now consider the case where $A$ is not [[bounded]]. Then we can write $\mathbb R^m$ as $\bigcup\limits_{n\in\mathbb N} \overline{Q_n}$ where the $Q_n$ are disjoint [[open]] [[rectangle|cubes]], and apply the previouis case to $A\cap Q_n$. The set $\mathbb R\setminus \bigcup\limits_{n\in\mathbb N} Q_n$ is of [[boundary of a rectangle is measure zero|measure zero]], so the result holds.
