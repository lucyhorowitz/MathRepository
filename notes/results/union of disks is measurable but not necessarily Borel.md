## Theorem
Let $I$ be an arbitrary index set and for each $i\in I$, let $D_i \subset \mathbb R^2$ be a [[closed]] disk. Then $$D=\bigcup_{i\in I} D\_i$$ is not always [[Borel σ-algebra|Borel]], but is always [[measurable]].
## Proof
It is [[nonexistence of countable σ-algebra|known]] that there are more than countably many [[Borel σ-algebra|Borel]] sets. More specifically, there are continuum-many [[Borel σ-algebra|Borel]] sets because the [[Borel σ-algebra]] is [[generate a σ-algebra|generated]] by the [[open]] balls, of which there are continuum-many. Taking countable unions, intersections, and relative complements [[cannot change this cardinality|invariance of cardinality under operations]]. However, there are strictly more than continuum-many possible unions of disks in $\mathbb R^2$. This is because we can take any subset $A$ of $\mathbb R^2$ (i.e. an element of $\mathcal P(\mathbb R)$) and map it to the set of all possible unions of disks by sending it to the union of the disks of radius 1 centered at each point in $A$. This gives an [[injective|injection]] from $\mathcal P(\mathbb R)$, which has cardinality strictly greater than that of $\mathbb R$ by [[Cantor's theorem]].

We can show the result for unions of disks that are [[bounded]] below in radius, because if we take a collection of disks $\{D_i\}_{i\in I}$, the countable union of the union of disks whose radii are greater than or equal to $\frac{1}{n}$ for every $n\in \mathbb N$ is equal to the union of the whole collection, and is still [[measurable]] (if this bounded union is) as the countable union of measurable sets. 

So consider a collection of disks whose radius is bounded below by 1. Let $$E = \bigcup_{i\in I} \text{int}(D_i)$$ be the union of the [[interior|interiors]] of all the $D_i$. Then $D\setminus E \subseteq \overline E\setminus E$. We will show that $\overline E \setminus E$ is of [[measure zero]] so that $D\setminus E$ is as well, and [[properties of measure density|since]] this is the set of points where the [[measure density|density]] in $D$ is not 1, that $D$ is [[measurable]]. Let $x \in \overline E\setminus E$. This point is not in the [[interior]] of any disk, but it is on the [[boundary]] of the union. For all $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists an element $D_i$ of the collection of disks such for which there exists $r > 0$ such that $\mu(D_i \cap B(x,r)) > \mu(B(x,r))/4$ for some constant $c > 0$. This implies that we can fit a ball of radius $\frac{r}{10}$ inside $D_i\cap B(x,r)$, which implies that $$d(\overline E\setminus E, x) < \frac{\pi r^2 - \pi\left(\frac{r}{10}\right)^2}{\pi r^2} = \frac{99}{100} < 1.$$ Thus the union $D$ is [[measurable]] for all index sets $I$.
