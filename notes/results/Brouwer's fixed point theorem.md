## Theorem
Every [[continuous]] function $f:D^n\to D^n$ has a fixed point.
## Proof
 Let $i:\partial D^n\to D^n$ be the inclusion map and suppose that some map from the [[boundary]] $\partial D^n$ of the disk to $D^n$ is a [[deformation retraction|retraction]]. Write $r:D^n\to \partial D^n$. Then $ri = \text{id}_{\partial D^n}$. Then considering the [[exact sequence on reduced homology of space and retractable subspace|exact sequence]] on [[reduced homology group|homology groups]] of $D^n$ and $\partial D^n$, the composition $$\tilde H_{n-1}(\partial D^n)\to \tilde H_{n-1}(D^n)\to \tilde H_{n-1}(\partial D^n)$$ is the [[identity function|identity]] on $\tilde H_{n-1}(\partial D^n) = \tilde H_{n-1}(S^{n-1}) = \mathbb Z$. But the [[continuous functions induce homomorphisms on homology groups|induced homomorphisms]] $i_*$ and $r_*$ are both 0 because $\tilde H_{n-1}(D^n) = 0$, a contradiction. Thus $r$ is not a [[deformation retraction|retraction]], and no retraction exists. Thus every [[continuous]] function from the disk to itself must have a fixed point. #todo fix the thing with the circle diagram
