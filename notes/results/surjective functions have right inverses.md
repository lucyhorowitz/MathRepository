## Theorem
A function $f:A\to B$ has a right [[inverse function|inverse]] if and only if it is [[surjective]].
## Proof
Suppose that $f$ is [[surjective]]. Then for each $b\in B$, there exists $a\in A$ such that $b=f(a)$. The function $g:B\to A$ that sends each $b$ to the $a\in A$ such that $b=f(a)$ defines a right [[inverse function|inverse]] of $f$.

Now suppose that $f$ has a right [[inverse function|inverse]]. Then for any $b\in B4$, $f(g(b))f(a)$ for some $a\in A$. Thus $f$ is [[surjective]].
