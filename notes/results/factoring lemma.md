## Theorem
Let $G$ be a [[group]] [[group action|acting]] on a set $X$ and let $x\in X$. Define a function $f:G\to Gx$ between $G$ and the [[orbit]] $Gx$ of $x$ under the $G$- [[group action|action]] by $f(g) = g\cdot x$ for all $g\in G$. Let $\pi: G\to G/\text{Stab}(x)$ be the [[canonical projection]] from $G$ to the [[quotient by subgroup|quotient]] of $G$ by the [[stabilizer under group action|stabilizer]] of $x$. Then there exists a [[bijective|bijection]] $\overline f:G/\text{Stab}(x) \to Gx$ such that $\overline f\circ \pi = f$.
