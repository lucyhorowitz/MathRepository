## Theorem
Let $G$ be a [[p-group]] [[group action|acting]] on the set $X$. Then the [[cardinal number]] of the set of [[group action invariants|invariants]] of the action is congruent to the [[cardinal number]] of $X$ modulo $p$. That is,
$$|X^G| \equiv |X| \pmod p.$$
## Proof
The complement of $X^G$ in $X$ is the disjoint union of the $G$-[[orbit|orbits]] of $X$. Each of these has [[cardinal number]] divisible by $p$.
