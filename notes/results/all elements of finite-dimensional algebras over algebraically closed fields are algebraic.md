## Theorem
Let $A$ be a finite-[[dimension of vector space|dimensional]] [[algebra over a field|algebra]] over a [[field]] $\mathbb k$ that is [[algebraically closed]]. Then
1. Every $a\in A$ is [[algebraic element of an algebra|algebraic]] and has nonempty [[spectrum]];
2. $A$ is a [[division algebra]] if and only if $A = \mathbb k$;
3. [[Schur's lemma for algebras]] holds for $A$ and the [[simplicity condition for module over countable-dimension algebra over C|simplicitly condition]] for [[semisimple module|semisimple]] [[module over a ring|modules]] over $A$ holds. 
## Proof
1. Since $A$ is finite-[[dimension of vector space|dimensional]], we have that for any $a\in A$, the [[subalgebra]] $A_a$ [[generate an associative algebra|generated]] by $a$ is of finite [[dimension of vector space|dimension]] over $\mathbb k$. Thus $a$  [[properties of algebraic elements of an algebra|is]] [[algebraic element of an algebra|algebraic]], so  $\text{spec}(a)$ is the collection of roots of the [[algebraic element of an algebra|minimal polynomial]] of $a$. This set is clearly finite and nonempty because $\mathbb k$ is [[algebraically closed]]. 
2. Follows from (1) and the proof of [[Schur's lemma for algebras]] over $\mathbb C$.
3. Follows from (1) and the proof of the [[simplicity condition for module over countable-dimension algebra over C]].
