## Theorem
[[curly P|Curly P]] is a [[prime ideal|prime]] [[ring ideal|ideal]] of the [[p-adic integers]].
## Proof
Recall that [[curly P is a maximal ideal]]. Because the [[p-adic integers]] are a [[commutative]] [[ring]], and [[maximal ring ideal|maximal]] [[ring ideal|ideals]] [[every maximal ideal in a commutative ring is prime|in commutative ideals are prime]], it follows that $\mathcal P$ is a [[prime ideal]].
