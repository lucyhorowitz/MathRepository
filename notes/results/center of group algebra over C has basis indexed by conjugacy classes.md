## Theorem
Let $G$ be a finite [[group]]. The [[center of an algebra|center]] of the [[group algebra]] $\mathbb C[G]$ has [[basis]] indexed by the [[conjugacy classes]] of $G$.
## Proof
#write_proof [[group algebra is sum of matrix algebras]] [[number of irreducible representations is equal to number of conjugacy classes]]
