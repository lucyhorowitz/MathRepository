## Theorem
Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] and let $X_\alpha$ be its [[connected component|connected components]]. Then there is an [[group homomorphism|isomorphism]] with the $n$th [[singular homology group]] $H_n(X)$ and the [[direct sum of groups|direct sum]] $$\bigoplus_\alpha H_n(X_\alpha).$$
