## Theorem
Let $X$ be a nonempty [[topological space]]. Then its $0$th [[singular homology group]] $H_0(X)$ is a [[direct sum of groups|direct sum]] of $k$ $\mathbb Z$s, one for each [[connected component]] of $X$.
## Proof
#write_proof  [[0th homology group of path-connected space is Z]] [[singular homology decomposes as path components]]
