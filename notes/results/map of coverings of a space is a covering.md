## Theorem
Let $E$, $E'$, and $B$ be [[connected]], [[locally path-connected]] [[topological space|topological spaces]] with $p:E\to B$ and $p':E'\to B$ [[covering space|covering spaces]] of $B$. Then a [[map of coverings of a space|map of coverings]] $g:E\to E'$ is itself a [[covering space]] of $E'$. 
## Proof
By the fact that a [[map of coverings of groupoids is a covering]], if we consider the [[fundamental groupoid|fundamental groupoids]] of our spaces and maps and then "go back down" to our $g$, we will be find it to be [[surjective]]. The [[covering space|fundamental neighborhoods]] for $g$ are the [[connected component|connected components]] of the [[inverse image|inverse images]] in $E'$ of the [[neighborhood|neighborhoods]] of $B$ that are [[covering space|fundamental]] for both $p$ and $p'$.
