## Theorem
Let $f(x) = \sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty a_nx^n$ be a [[power series]] with coefficients $a_n$ in the [[Banach algebra]] $A$ with [[radius of convergence]] $r$. Then for all $x\in \mathbb R$, the [[differentiable|derivative]] of $f(x)$, $$f'(x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty na_nx^{n-1}$$ also [[series convergence|converges]] with [[radius of convergence]] $r$.
