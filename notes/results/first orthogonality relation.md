## Theorem

Let $\chi_i$ and $\chi_j$ be two [[irreducible representation|irreducible]] [[character of a representation|characters]] of a [[group]] $G$. If $G$ is finite, then $\langle \chi_i, \chi_j\rangle = \delta_{ij}$, where the [[inner product]] is the [[Hermitian inner product on class functions on finite group|inner product on class functions]] of a finite group and $\delta_{ij}$ is the [[Kronecker delta]]. That is, $$\langle\chi_i ,\chi_j\rangle = \begin{cases}1 & i = j \\ 0 & i\neq j. \end{cases}$$

Moreover, $\langle\chi,\chi\rangle=1$ if and only if $\chi$ is an  [[irreducible representation|irreducible]] [[character of a representation|character]] of $G$.

If $G$ is not finite, then the same result holds using instead the [[L2 inner product on group functions]].

For any [[group representation|representation]] $\chi$ and [[irreducible representation]] $\psi$, $\langle \chi,\psi\rangle$ is equal to the multiplicity of $\psi$ in the [[complete reducibility|decomposition]] of $\chi$. This is always well-defined because [[representations of finite groups are completely reducible]].
