## Theorem
Let $p:\mathcal E\to \mathcal B$ be a [[covering of groupoids]]. Then any two [[fiber|fibers]] $F_b$ and $F_{b'}$ have the same [[cardinal number]]. 
## Proof
For $f:b\to b'$, the [[fiber translation functor]] $T(f):F_b\to F_{b'}$ is a [[bijective|bijection]] with [[inverse function|inverse]] $T(f^{-1})$. #todo  there is more to write here. fill in the gaps
