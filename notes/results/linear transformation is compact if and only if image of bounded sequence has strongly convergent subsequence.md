## Theorem
Let $T:H\to H$ be a [[linear transformation]] from the [[Hilbert space]] $H$ to itself. Then $T$ is [[compact linear transformation|compact]] if and only if for $\{x_n\}_{n\in\mathbb N}$ a [[bounded]] sequence, the [[image]] $\{T(x_n)\}_{n\in\mathbb N}$ has a [[sequence convergence|strongly convergent]] subsequence.
