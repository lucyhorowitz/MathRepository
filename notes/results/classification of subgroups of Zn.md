## Theorem
Any [[subgroup]] of $\mathbb Z^n$ is [[group homomorphism|isomorphic]] to $\mathbb Z^m$ for $m \in \{0,\dots, n\}$. Note that $\mathbb Z^0$ is the [[identity element|trivial]] [[group]] $\{0\}$. 
## Proof
[[classification of subgroups of Z x G for abelian G]] [[classification of subgroups of Z]]
