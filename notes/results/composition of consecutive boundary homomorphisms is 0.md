## Theorem
Let $X$ be a [[âˆ†-complex]] (or a [[topological space]]) and consider the [[boundary homomorphism|boundary homomorphisms]] $\partial_n:\Delta_n(X) \to \Delta_{n-1}(X)$ between elements of the [[chain complex]] on [[n-chain|n-chains]]. Then the composition $$\partial_{n-1}\circ\partial_n$$ is identically zero.
