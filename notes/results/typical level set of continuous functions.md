## Theorem
For a [[typical]] [[continuous]] function $f:[0,1]\to\mathbb R$, for all except [[countable|countably many]] $y \in [\min f, \max f]$, the [[level set]] $f^{-1}(y)$ is a [[Cantor set]]. There is a [[countable]] [[dense]] set of $y \in (\min f, \max f)$ for which $f^{-1}(y)$ is a [[Cantor set]] together with one [[isolated point]].
## Proof
#write_proof [[closed]] [[level set of continuous function is closed]] [[local minimum]] [[local maximum]]
