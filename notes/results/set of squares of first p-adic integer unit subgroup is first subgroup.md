## Theorem
Consider [[p-adic field|Qp]] for an odd [[prime number|prime]] $p$. then the set of squares of the first [[subgroup]] [[subgroups of p-adic integer units|of]] the [[group]] of [[unit of a ring|units]] of the [[p-adic integers]] is equal to itself. That is, if $U_1= \{x\in \mathbb Q_p \mid |x|_p = 1\}$, then $(U_1)^2=U_1$.
