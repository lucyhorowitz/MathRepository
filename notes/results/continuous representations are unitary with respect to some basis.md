## Theorem
Let $G$ be a [[topological group]]. Any [[continuous group representation]] $\rho:G\to GL(V)$ "can be made [[unitary group representation|unitary]]." That is, there exists some [[basis]] of $V$ such that all matrices $\rho(g) = \rho_{ij}(g)$ is a [[unitary matrix]].

## Proof
Choose a [[basis]] $\{e_i\}_{i=1}^n$ for $V$. This gives a natural identification of $V$ with $\mathbb C^n$, which comes with the standard [[Hermitian inner product]] given by $$\langle u,v\rangle = \sum_{i=1}^n u_i\overline{v_i}.$$ 
Define a new [[Hermitian inner product]] on $V$ by $$\langle u,v\rangle_{\text{Av}} = \frac{1}{\text{vol}(G)}\int_G \langle \rho(g)u, \rho(g)v\rangle\text dg$$ where the integral is the [[Haar integral]] and $\text{vol}(G)$ is the [[volume of compact topological space|volume]] of $G$. We will show that this new inner product is a [[G-invariant function]].

Let $G$ [[group action|act]] diagonally on $V\times V$ via the initital [[group representation|representation]], i.e. consider $g:(u,v) \mapsto (\rho(g)v, \rho(g)u)$. Then the original [[inner product]] is a function on $V\times V$ with $(u,v)\mapsto \langle u,v\rangle$. By the fact that [[averaging is G-invariant]], and moreover because $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle_\text{Av}$ is by construction the [[averaging]], we have [[G-invariant function|invariance]]. We need now only show that $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle$ is in fact [[Hermitian inner product]]. Biadditivity follows from [[linearity of the integral]], and linearity with respect to scalars is also obvious. [[positive definite|Positive definiteness]] is the key, but it follows from [[properties of the integral|positivity]] of the [[Haar integral]] and of the initial inner product, because it is [[Hermitian inner product|Hermitian]].
