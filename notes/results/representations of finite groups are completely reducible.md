## Theorem
Any finite-[[dimension of group representation|dimensional]] complex [[group representation|representation]] of a finite [[group]] is [[complete reducibility|completely reducible]]. 
## Proof
Every finite [[group]] is a [[topological group]] with the [[discrete topology]], and moreover it is [[finite sets are compact|necessarily]] [[compact]]. Moreover, all [[functions from discrete spaces are continuous]] so we can apply the theorem that [[continuous complex representations of compact groups are completely reducible]].
