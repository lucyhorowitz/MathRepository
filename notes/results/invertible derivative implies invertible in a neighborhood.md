## Theorem
Let $U \subset \mathbb R^n$ be [[open]]. Let $f: U\to\mathbb R^n$ be of [[class]] $C^1$. If $Df(a)$ is invertible, then there exists an $\alpha > 0$ such that $$||f(x_1)-f(x_2)|| \geq \alpha||x_1-x_2||$$ for all $x_1,x_2$ in some open ball $B(a,\varepsilon)$ centered at $a$. It follows that $f$ is [[bijective]] on $B$.
