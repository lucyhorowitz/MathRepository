## Theorem
Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] and let $\mathcal U = \{U_j\}$ be a collection of [[subspace topology|subspaces]] of $X$ whose [[interior|interiors]] form an [[open cover]] of $X$. Let $C_n(X)$ be the [[group]] of [[n-chain|n-chains]] in the [[chain complex]] of $X$. Then let $C_n^{\mathcal U}(X)$ be the [[subgroup]] of $C_n(X)$ consisting of [[n-chain|n-chains]] $\sum_i n_i\sigma_i$ such that each $\sigma_i$ has [[image]] ( #todo: under what?) contained in the cover $\mathcal U$. Then the [[boundary homomorphism]] $\partial: C_n(X) \to C_{n-1} (X)$ takes $C_n^{\mathcal U}(X)$ to $C_{n-1}^{\mathcal U}(X)$ so the groups $C_n^{\mathcal U}(X)$ form a [[chain complex]]. Denote the [[homology group|homology groups]] of this [[chain complex]] by $H_n^{\mathcal U}(X)$.

The inclusion map $\iota: C_n^\mathcal U(X) \hookrightarrow C_n(X)$ is a [[chain homotopy]] equivalence. That is, there exists a [[chain map]] $\rho:C_n(X) \to C_n^\mathcal U(X)$ such that $\iota\rho$ and $\rho\iota$ are [[chain homotopy|chain homotopic]] to the identity. [[chain homotopic maps induce the same homomorphism on homology|Hence]] $\iota$ [[continuous functions induce homomorphisms on homology groups|induces]] [[group homomorphism|isomorphisms]] $H_n^\mathcal (X) \cong H_n(X)$ for all $n$.
