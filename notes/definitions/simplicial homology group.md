Consider a [[chain complex]] whose [[abelian]] [[group|groups]] are the groups of [[n-chain|n-chains]] of a [[âˆ†-complex]] $X$. The $n$th [[homology group]] $\text{Ker}(\partial_{n})/\text{Im}(\partial_{n+1})$ is denoted $H_n^\Delta(X)$ and is called the $n$th **simplicial homology group** of $X$.
