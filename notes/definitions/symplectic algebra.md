Let $V$ be a finite-[[dimension of vector space|dimensional]] [[vector space]] with $\text{dim}(V)=2\ell$ with [[basis]] $\{v_1,\dots,v_{2\ell}\}$. Define a nondegenerate [[skew-symmetric]] [[form]] $f$ on $V$ with the [[matrix of a linear transformation|matrix]] $$s = \begin{bmatrix}0 & I_\ell \\ -I_\ell & 0\end{bmatrix}.$$ Note that the [[dimension of vector space|dimension]] being even is required for the existence of a nondegenerate [[multilinear|bilinear]] form satisfying $f(v,w) = -f(w,v)$. Then denote by $\mathfrak{sp}(V)$ the **symplectic algebra** consisting of all [[endomorphism|endomorphisms]] $x$ of $V$ such that $f(x(v),w) = -f(v,x(w)).$
