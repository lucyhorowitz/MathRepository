A **ring homomorphism** is a map $f:S\to R$ between [[ring|rings]] $S$ and $R$ such that 
- $f:(S,+) \to (R,+)$ is a [[group homomorphism]];
- $f(s_1s_2)= f(s_1)f(s_2)$ for all $s_1,s_2\in S$;
- $f(1) = 1$.

A **ring [[isomorphism]]** is a homomorphism that happens to also be a [[bijective|bijection]].
