## Theorem
Let $G$ be a [[group]] and $N$ a [[normal subgroup]] of $G$. Define an [[equivalence relation]] $\sim$ by setting $g\sim h$ if $g,h \in H$. Then the **quotient of $G$ by $N$** (written $G/N$) is the [[quotient by equivalence relation|quotient]] by $\sim$ of $N$.
## Proof
Let $f:G\to H$ be a [[group homomorphism]] and let $K$ be the [[kernel of group homomorphism|kernel]] of this map.
