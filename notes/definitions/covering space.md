A **covering space** of a [[topological space]] $X$ is another [[topological space]] $\tilde X$ together with a [[continuous]] map $p:\tilde X\to X$ such that there exists an [[open]] cover $\{U_\alpha\}$ of of $X$ such that for all $\alpha$, the [[inverse image]] $p^{-1}(U_\alpha)$ is a disjoint union of [[open]] sets in $\tilde X$, each of which is mapped [[homeomorphism|homeomorphically]] [[surjective|onto]] $U_\alpha$. Note that $p^{-1}(U_\alpha)$ does not need to be nonempty. Thus $p$ need not be [[surjective]]. [[Algebraic Topology|]]

Alternatively, let $E$ and $B$ be [[locally path-connected]] [[topological space|topological spaces]]. A [[continuous]] function $p:E\to B$ is a **covering space** (of $B$?) if it is [[surjective]] and if each point $p\in B$ has an [[open]] [[neighborhood]] $V$ such that each [[connected component]] of the [[inverse image]] $p^{-1}(V)$ is [[open]] in $E$ and is mapped [[homeomorphism|homeomorphically]] onto $V$ by $p$. A [[path-connected]] [[open]] subset $V$ with this property is a **fundamental neighborhood** of $B$. The space $E$ is called the **total space** and the space $B$ is called the **base space**.  Write the [[fiber]] of the point $b$ as $F_b = p^{-1}(b)$. [[A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology|]]
