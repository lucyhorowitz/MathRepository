A **field** is a set $F$ together with two [[binary operation|binary operations]] addition ($+$) and multiplication ($\cdot$) such that
- Addition and multiplication are both [[associative]];
- Addition and multiplication are both [[commutative]];
- There exist two distinct elements $0\neq 1$ in $F$ such that $0$ is an additive [[identity element|identity]] and $1$ is a multiplicative [[identity element|identity]];
- Every element of $F$ has an additive [[inverse element|inverse]];
- Every nonzero element of $F$ has a multiplicative [[inverse element|inverse]];
- Multiplication distributes over addition as follows: $a\cdot (b+c) = (a\cdot b) + (a\cdot c)$ for all $a,b,c\in F$. 

Equivalently, a **field** is a [[commutative]] [[division ring]].
