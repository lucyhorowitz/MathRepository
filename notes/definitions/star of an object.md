Let $\mathcal C$ be a [[small category|small]] [[groupoid]] and let $x$ be an object of $\mathcal C$. The **star** of $x$, denoted $\text{St}(x)$, is the set of objects of the [[category of objects under x]]. That is, it is the set of morphisms with source $x$. 

The [[group]] $\mathcal C(x,x)$ of [[automorphism|automorphisms]] of $x$ is written $\pi(\mathcal C,x)$.
