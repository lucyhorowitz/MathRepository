An [[open cover]] $\{U\}$ of a [[topological space]] $B$ is **numerable** if for each $U$ there exist [[continuous]] maps $\lambda_U:B\to I$ (where $I$ is the unit [[interval]]) such that the [[inverse image]] $\lambda_U^{-1}((0,1]) = U$ and if the cover is [[locally finite cover|locally finite]].

#todo this seems to have a double word
