If $\sigma \in S_n$ is an element of the [[symmetric group]] on $n$ letters, then it [[cycle decomposition|is]] the product of disjoint [[cycle|cycles]] of length $n_1\leq\cdots\leq n_r$ (including the $1$-cycles!) and moreover the sum of the $n_i$ is equal to $n$. The [[partition of an integer|partition]] of $n$ given by the $n_i$ is called the **cycle type** of $\sigma$.
