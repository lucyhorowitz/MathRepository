A **topological space** is a set $X$ together with a collection $T$ of subsets of $X$. The elements of $T$ are called the [[open]] sets and they satisfy the following properties:
1. $X\in T$ and $\emptyset \in T$.
2. Arbitrary unions of open sets are open.
3. Finite intersections of open sets are open.

The choice of $T$ is called a **topology** on $X$.
