aliases: cofiber homotopy equivalence

Let $A$ be a [[compactly generated]] [[topological space]]. A **space under $A$** (that is, an object of the [[category]]) is a map $i:A\to X$. A morphism between spaces under $A$ is a [[commutative diagram]] ![[Screen Shot 2022-02-25 at 10.25.41 PM.png]]

This is a [[homotopy category]]: a [[homotopy]] $h$ between maps under $A$ is a [[homotopy]] that at each "time" $t$ is a map under $A$. Then we write $h:f\simeq f' \text{ rel } A$ and $h(i(a),t) = j(a)$ for all $a\in A$ and $t\in I$. 

The above notion of [[homotopy equivalence of spaces|homotopy equivalence]] is called **cofiber homotopy equivalence**.
