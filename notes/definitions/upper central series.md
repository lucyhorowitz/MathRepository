Let $G$ be a [[group]]. The **upper central series** for $G$ is an ascending sequence of [[subgroup|subgroups]] of $G$ defined as follows: Let $Z_0(G) = \{e\}$ and let $Z_1(G)$ be the [[center of a group|center]] $Z(G)$. Then for each $i\geq 1$, define $Z_{i+1}(G)$ to be a [[subgroup]] of $G$ containing $Z_i(G)$ such that the [[quotient by normal subgroup|quotient]] $Z_{i+1}(G)/Z_i(G) = Z(G/Z_i(G))$.  Note that because the [[center is a normal subgroup]], these [[quotient by normal subgroup|quotients]] are well-defined. Also note that this series may or may not reach $G$.
