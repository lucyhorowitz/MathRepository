Let $x$ be a [[unit of a ring|unit]] of the [[p-adic field]] $\mathbb Q_p$. That is, let $x\in\mathbb Q_p^\times$. Then $x$ has a unique [[p-adic expansion is unique|p-adic expansion]] $$x= \sum_{n=\text{val}(x)}^\infty a_np^n.$$ Denote by $\lambda(x)$ the sum $$\lambda(x) = \sum_{n=\text{val}(x)}^{-1}a_np^n$$ and call it the **tail** of $x$. Then we define the **basic additive character** $\psi:\mathbb Q_p\to \mathbb T\subseteq \mathbb C^\times$ (the middle set being the [[circle group]]) by $$\psi(x) = e^{2\pi i \lambda(x)}.$$
## Proof that it is a [[multiplicative character|character]]:
First we check that it is a [[group homomorphism]]: If $x,y$ are [[p-adic integers]], then $x+y \in \mathbb Z_p$ as well and moreover $\psi(x) = \psi(y) = \psi(x+y) = 1$ because the [[conductor of a multiplicative character|conductor]] of $\psi$ [[conductor of basic additive character is p-adic integers|is]] the [[p-adic integers]]. Suppose that $y\notin \mathbb Z_p$ and without loss of generality that the [[valuation]] $\text{val}(x)\leq \text{val}(y)$. Then write the tails as $$\lambda(x) = \sum_{n=v(x)}^{-1}a_np^n \text{ and } \lambda(y) = \sum_{n=v(y)}^{-1}b_np^n.$$ Note that $\lambda(x)+\lambda(y) - \lambda(x+y)$ must either be equal to zero or one "depending on carrying." Then $$\psi(x+y) = e^{2\pi i (\lambda(x+y))} = e^{2\pi i (\lambda(x)+ \lambda(y))} = e^{2\pi i \lambda(x)}e^{2\pi i \lambda(y)} =\psi(x)\psi(y)$$ because $e^{2\pi t}$ is an integer-[[periodic function]] of $t$. Thus $\psi$ is a homomorphism.

Now note that because a [[group homomorphism|homomorphism]] from one [[topological group]] to another is [[continuous]] [[homomorphism is continuous if and only if it is continuous at e|if and only if]] it is [[continuous]] at the [[identity element]], we just need to show that $\psi$ is continuous at $0$. For any $\varepsilon$, we can choose $\delta \leq 1$ such that if $|x-0|_p<\delta$, then $x\in \mathbb Z_p$ by definition. This implies by the above that $\psi(x)=1$, so $|\psi(x) - \psi(0)| = 0<\varepsilon$ under the [[complex numbers|complex]] [[absolute value]].

## Auxiliary definition
We can also define a "scalar multiple" of the character by defining, for each $u\in\mathbb Q_p$, a new function $\psi_u:\mathbb Q_p\to \mathbb T$ by $x\mapsto \psi(ux)$.  
## Proof that it is a [[multiplicative character|character]]
First, we show that $\psi_u$ is a [[group homomorphism]]: $$\psi_u(x+y) = \psi(u(x+y)) = \psi(ux+uy) = \psi(ux)\psi(uy) = \psi_u(x)\psi_u(y)$$ from the fact that $\psi$ is itself a [[group homomorphism]]. 

Finally, $\psi_u$ is [[continuous]] because the [[composition of continuous functions is continuous]] and $\psi$ is the composition of $\psi$, which is itself [[continuous]] by virtue of it being a [[multiplicative character]], and because $\mathbb Q_p$ [[Qp is a topological field|is]] a [[topological field]], the map given by "multiplication by $u$" is also [[continuous]].
