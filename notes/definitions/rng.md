A **rng** is a set $R$ together with two [[binary operation|binary operations]] $+$ and $\cdot$ such that
1. $R$ is an [[abelian]] [[group]] under $+$;
2. $R$ is a [[semigroup]] under $\cdot$;
3. $\cdot$ distributes over $+$: $a\cdot (b+c)=(a\cdot b) + (a\cdot c)$ and $(b+c)\cdot a = (b\cdot a) + (c\cdot a)$.

Note that this is essentially the definition of [[ring]] without a multiplicative [[identity element|identity]].
