The **complex orthogonal group** $\text{O}(n,\mathbb C)$ is the set of $n\times n$ complex [[matrix|matrices]] whose [[matrix transpose|transposes]] are equal to their [[inverse matrix|inverses]]. 

This definition mirrors the definition of the real [[orthogonal group]], but instead we consider complex-valued matrices.

It is a [[matrix Lie group]] because it is a [[subgroup]] of the [[general linear group]] $\text{GL}(n,\mathbb C)$.
