Let $G$ be a [[group]] and $R$ a [[ring]]. The **group ring** $RG$ is the set of formal sums of elements in $G$ with coefficients in $R$. By convention, $1\cdot g = g$ and $0\cdot g$ terms are omitted from the sum. Addition is defined by components and multiplication is defined by $$(ag_i)(bg_j) = abg_k$$ where $g_ig_j = g_k$, and extended distributively.
