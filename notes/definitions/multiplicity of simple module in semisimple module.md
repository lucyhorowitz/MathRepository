Let $A$ be an [[algebra over a field|algebra]] over an [[algebraically closed]] [[field]] $\mathbb k$ and let $M$ be a [[semisimple module|semisimple]] [[module over a ring|module]] over $A$ of finite [[dimension of vector space|dimension]] over $\mathbb k$. The number of times the [[module over a ring|module]] $V$ appears in a direct sum decomposition of $M$ is denoted $[M:V]$ and is called the **multiplicity of $V$ in $M$**.
