A **signed measure** on the [[measurable|measurable space]] $(X,\Sigma)$ is a function $$\mu: \Sigma \to \mathbb R \cup \{-\infty\} \text{ or } \mathbb R \cup \{\infty\}$$ such that $\mu(\emptyset) =0$ and $\mu$ is [[Ïƒ-additive]]. Note that $\mu$ cannot take on both $-\infty$ and $\infty$ as values.
