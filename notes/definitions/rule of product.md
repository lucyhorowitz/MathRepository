If there are $a$ ways of doing one thing and $b$ ways of doing another thing, then there are $ab$ ways of doing both things.  This can be extended [[induction|inductively]].

Set theoretically, this is the definition of the product of [[cardinal numbers]]: $$|S_1|\cdot|S_2|\cdots|S_n| = |S_1\times S_2\times\cdots S_n|$$ where $|\cdot|$ is the [[cardinal number]] of the sets $S_i$ and $\times$ is the [[Cartesian product]] of sets. The sets need not be finite nor does the number of sets.
