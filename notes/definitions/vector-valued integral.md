Let $X$ be a [[locally compact]] [[Hausdorff]] [[topological space]]. Fix an [[Lebesgue integral|integral]] $\int_X$ and $V$ a finite-[[dimension of vector space|dimensional]] [[vector space]]. Choose a [[basis]] $\{v_i\}_{i=1}^n$ for $V$ so that any [[continuous]] function $f:X\to V$ can be expressed as $$f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n f_(x)v_i \text{ for all } x\in X$$ where the $f_i$ are the [[component function|components]] of $f$. Define the **vector-valued integral** of $f$ as $$\int_X f(x) \text{d} x = \sum_{i=1}^n \left(\int_X f_i(x)\text dx \right)v_i.$$ We can say that it is given by the integrals of the coordinates.
