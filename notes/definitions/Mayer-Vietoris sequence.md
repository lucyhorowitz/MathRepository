Let $A$ and $B$ be [[subspace topology|subspaces]] of the [[topological space]] $X$ such that $X$ is the union of the [[interior|interiors]] of $A$ and $B$. A **Mayer-Vietoris sequence** is an [[exact sequence]] of the form $$\cdots\to H_n(A\cap B)\to H_n(A)\oplus H_n(B) \to H_n(X) \to H_{n-1}(A\cap B) \to\cdots$$$$\to H_0(X) \to 0.$$The arrows between $H_n(A\cap B)$ and $H_n(A)\oplus H_n(B)$ are generally labeled $\Phi$, the arrows between $H_n(A)\oplus H_n(B)$ and $H_n(X)$ are generally labeled $\Psi$, and the arrows between degrees (the [[boundary homomorphism|boundary homomorphisms]]) are as usual denoted $\partial$.
