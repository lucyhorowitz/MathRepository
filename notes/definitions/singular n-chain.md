Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] and let $C_n(X)$ be the [[free group]] [[abelian]] [[group]] on the set of [[singular n-simplex|singular n-simplices]] in $X$. Elements of $C_n(X)$ are called **singular $n$-chains** and are written as finite formal sums $$\sum_i n_i\sigma_i$$ for $n_i\in\mathbb Z$ and $\sigma_i:\Delta^n\to X$.
