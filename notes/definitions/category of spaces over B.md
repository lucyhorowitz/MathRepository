aliases: fiber homotopy equivalence

Let $B$ be a [[compactly generated]] [[topological space]]. A **space over $A$** (that is, an object of the [[category]]) is a map $p:E\to B$. A morphism between spaces under $A$ is a [[commutative diagram]] ![[Screen Shot 2022-02-26 at 12.02.17 PM.png]]

This is a [[homotopy category]]: a [[homotopy]] $h$ between maps over $B$ is a [[homotopy]] that at each "time" $t$ is a map over $B$. 

The above notion of [[homotopy equivalence of spaces|homotopy equivalence]] is called **fiber homotopy equivalence**.  It is dual to [[category of spaces under A|cofiber homotopy equivalence]].
