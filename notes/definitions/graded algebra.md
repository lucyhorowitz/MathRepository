A **graded algebra** over the [[field]] $k$ is a [[graded vector space]] $A = \bigoplus_{i\geq 0} A_i$ equipped with an [[algebra over a field|algebra]] structure such that 
1. multiplication is compatible with the grading: i.e. $A_iA_i\subseteq A_{i+j}$ for all $i,j\geq 0$.
2. The [[identity element]] on $A$, written $1_A$, is in $A_0$.
