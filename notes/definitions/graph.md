A **graph** $X$ is a [[topological space]] obtained from a discrete set $X^0$ of points called **vertices** and a discrete set $J$ of functions $j:S^0\to X^0$ as the [[quotient of topological spaces|quotient space]] of the disjoint union $X^0/\coprod (J\times I)$ where $I$ is the unit [[interval]] obtained by identifying $(j,0)$ with $j(0)$ and $(j,1)$ with $j(1)$. The images of the [[interval|intervals]] $j\times I$ are called **edges**.

A **graph** can also be though of as a 1-dimensional [[CW complex]] whose $0$-cells are the vertices and whose $1$-cells are the edges and where the endpoints of each edge are identified with the vertices attached to it.
