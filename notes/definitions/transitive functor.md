In light of the [[functor|functorial]] definition of [[group action|group actions]], we can think of a covariant [[functor]] $T:\mathcal B\to \mathcal S$ from a [[small category|small]] [[groupoid]] to the [[category of sets]] as a generalization of a [[group action]].

For each object $b$ of $\mathcal B$, $T$ restricts to an [[group action|action]] of the [[group]] $\pi(\mathcal B,b)$[^1]. Then $T$ is **transitive** if this [[group action]] is [[transitive group action|transitive]] for all objects $b$. 

Note that if $\mathcal B$ is [[connected category|connected]], if the restriction of $T$ on $\pi(\mathcal B,b)$ is [[transitive group action|transitive]] for one object $b$ then it is transitive for all objects $b$.

[^1]: Note that $\pi(\mathcal B,b)$ denotes the [[automorphism group]] of $b$ as in the definition of [[star of an object]].
