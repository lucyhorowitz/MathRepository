Fix $\{V_i\}_{i\in \mathbb N}$ a (possibly infinite) sequence of finite-[[dimension of vector space|dimensional]] [[vector space|vector spaces]] over a [[field]] $k$. Then we can define $$V = \bigoplus_{i\geq 0}V_i = \{(v_{i_1},\dots, v_{i_N}) \mid N\in \mathbb N, v_{i_k} \in V_{i_k}\}.$$ If we consider each $V_i$ as a [[linearly independent]] [[subspace topology|subspace]] of $V$, we can consider the tuples as finite sums of vectors. Such a $V$ is a **graded vector space**.
