The **Lebesgue measure** on $\mathbb R^n$ is constructed as follows: 

A set $A \subset\mathbb R^n$ is **Lebesgue measurable** if for every $S\subset \mathbb R^n$, we have the following relation in the [[Lebesgue outer measure]] $\lambda^*$: $$\lambda^*(S) = \lambda^*(S\cap A) + \lambda^*(S\setminus A).$$ 

By [[Carathéodory's extension theorem]], Lebesgue measurable sets $A$ form a [[σ-algebra]] and the Lebesgue measure of any such set coincides with its [[Lebesgue outer measure]].
