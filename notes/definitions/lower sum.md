Let $f: Q\to \mathbb R$ be a [[bounded]] function defined on the [[rectangle]] $Q$ and let $P$ be a [[partition of a set]] of $Q$. For each [[subrectangle]] $R$ determined by $P$, let $m_R(f) = \inf\limits_{x\in R} f(x)$. The **lower sum** for $f$ determined by $P$ is $$L(f,P) = \sum_{R} m_R(f)\text{vol}(R)$$ where $\text{vol}$ is the [[volume]] of the [[rectangle]] $R$.
