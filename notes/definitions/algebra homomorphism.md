Let $A$ and $B$ be two [[algebra over a field|algebras]] over the [[field]] or [[commutative]] [[ring]] $K$. Then an **algebra [[homomorphism]]** between $A$ and $B$ is a map $f:A\to B$ such that 
1. $f(kx) = kf(x)$
2. $f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y)$
3. $f(xy) = f(x)f(y)$

for all $k\in K$ and $x,y\in A$.

If an algebra [[homomorphism]] is [[bijective]], then it is an [[isomorphism]] of algebras.
