Let $L$ be a [[Lie algebra]] and $I\subset L$ an [[ideal of a Lie algebra|ideal]]. Then the **quotient** $L / I$ is constructed as follows:
- The underlying [[vector space]] is the usual [[quotient vector space]] $L/I$ when $L$ and $I$ are considered as [[vector space|vector spaces]]. 
- Lie multiplication is given by $[x+I,y+I] = [xy]+I$.
