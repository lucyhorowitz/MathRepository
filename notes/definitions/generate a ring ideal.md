The [[ring ideal|ideal]] **generated** by a subset $T$ of a [[ring]] $R$ is the smallest [[ring ideal|ideal]] containing $T$. 

Equivalently, $(T) = \bigcap\limits_{I\supseteq T} I$ where $I$ varies over all of the [[ring ideal|ideals]] in 
$R$ that contain $T$. 

Equivalently, if $T = \{t_i\}_{i=1}^n$, then $(T) = \left\{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n r_it_i\right\}$ , the set of all formal sums of elements of $T$ with coefficients in $R$.
