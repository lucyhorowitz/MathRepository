Let $X$ be a [[topological space]]. An **open cover** of $A$ is a collection of [[open]] subsets of $X$ such that $A$ lies in the union of the elements of the collection. That is, an open covering is a collection $\{G_\lambda\}_{\lambda\in\Lambda}$ of subsets of $X$ such that $A\subset \bigcup\limits_{\lambda\in\Lambda} G_\lambda$.
