Let $P = \mathbb C[x_1,\dots, x_n]$ be the [[graded algebra|graded]] [[polynomial ring|polynomial]] [[polynomial ring is a graded algebra|algebra]]  and let $P^d$ be the [[vector subspace|subspace]] of [[degree of polynomial|degree]]-$d$ [[homogeneous polynomial|homogeneous]] polynomials. Let $\lambda$ be a [[partition of an integer|partition]] of $n$. Then define $V(\lambda)= \mathbb C\text{-span}\{s(\Delta_\lambda) \mid s\in S_n\}$. That is, $V(\lambda)$ is the collection of $\mathbb C$-linear combinations of [[image|images]] of the [[Vandermonde determinant|Vandermonde polynomial]] under the [[group action|action]] of the [[symmetric group]] $S_n$ on variables by permutation.

It is an $S_n$-[[G-invariant subspace|invariant]] [[vector subspace|subspace]] of $P^{d_\lambda}$, and moreover it defines a [[group representation|representation]] of $S_n$ $\rho:S_n\to GL(V(\lambda))$ called the **Specht [[module over a ring|module]]** associated to $\lambda$. It is a [[module over a ring|module]] via the [[representations are modules over group algebra|correspondence]] between [[group representation|representations]] and [[module over a ring|modules]] over the [[group algebra]].
