Let $(V,\rho)$ be a [[group representation|representation]] of a [[group]] $G$ where $V$ is a [[vector space]] over the [[field]] $F$. The **character** of this representation is the function $\chi_\rho:G\to F$ given by $\chi_\rho(g) = \text{Tr}(\rho(g))$. We know that the [[trace]] is [[invariance of trace|independent]] of a choice of [[basis]] for $V$.

#todo how the hell is this not on WikiData but the character table is?
