Assuming the [[Axiom of Choice]], the **cardinality** of a set $X$ is the least [[ordinal number]] $\alpha$ such that there exists a [[bijective|bijection]] between $X$ and $\alpha$. 

There exists a [[well-ordering]] on the cardinal numbers under the relation $|A| \leq |B|$ if and only if there exists an [[injective|injection]] from $A$ to $B$.
