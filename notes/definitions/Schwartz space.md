Let $F$ be a [[local field|local]] [[field]] with a [[non-Archimedean absolute value|non-Archimedean]] [[absolute value]]. Then the **Schwartz space**, or the collection of **Schwartz-Bruhat functions**, consists of the functions from $F$ to $\mathbb C$ that are [[locally constant]] and have [[compact support]].

It is often either denoted $C_c^\infty(F)$ or $\mathcal S(F)$.
