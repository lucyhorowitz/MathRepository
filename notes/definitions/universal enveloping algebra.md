Let $\mathfrak g$ be a [[Lie algebra]] over the [[field]] $F$ with a [[basis]] $\{x_i\}$ and a Lie bracket given by $$[x_i,x_j] = \sum_k = c_{ij}^kx_k.$$ The **universal enveloping algebra** $\mathcal U(\mathfrak g)$ is the [[associative algebra]] [[generate an associative algebra|generated]] by the $x_i$ with the relations $$x_ix_j-x_jx_i = \sum_k c_{ij}^k x_k.$$ The $c_{ij}^k$ are the [[structure constants]] of $\mathcal U(\mathfrak g)$.

The [[universal property]] for the universal enveloping algebra is as follows: Let $\mathfrak g$ be a [[Lie algebra]] over the [[field]] $F$ and let $A$ be an [[associative algebra]] over $F$. By endowing $A$ with the [[commutator]] as a Lie bracket, $A$ becomes a [[Lie algebra]]. Let $\phi: \mathfrak g \to A$ be a [[Lie algebra homomorphism]]. Then the **universal enveloping algebra** $\mathcal U(\mathfrak g)$ is the algebra such that the following [[commutative diagram|diagram commutes]]:

In a [[basis]]-free setting, let $\mathfrak g$ be a [[Lie algebra]] over the [[field]] $F$ and let $T\mathfrak g$ be the [[tensor algebra]] of $\mathfrak g$. Consider the [[ideal]] $$\mathcal I = \langle x\otimes y - y\otimes x - [x,y] \mid x,y \in \mathfrak g\rangle$$ of $T\mathfrak g$. Then the **universal enveloping algebra** $\mathcal U(\mathfrak g)$ is defined as the [[quotient of Lie algebra by ideal|quotient]] $T\mathfrak g/\mathcal I$.
