Let $G$ be a [[group]]. The **lower central series** for $G$ is defined as follows: Let $G_0=G$, let $G_1 = [G,G]$, and for each $i \geq 1$, define $G_{i+1} = [G,G_{i}]$ where the bracket notation denotes a particular [[subgroup]] of the [[commutator subgroup]]: $[G,H] = \{ghg^{-1}h^{-1}\mid g\in G, h\in H\}$. Note that this series may or may not reach the [[identity element|trivial]] [[subgroup]].
