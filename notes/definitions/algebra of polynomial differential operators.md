Consider the [[polynomial ring]] $P_n =\mathbb C[x_1,\dots,x_n]$. Let $\partial_i = \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}$ be the [[partial derivative]] with respect to the variable $x_i$. Note that it is a [[linear transformation]] from $P_n$ to itself. Let $D_n$ be the [[subalgebra]] of the [[algebra of linear maps|algebra]] of $\mathbb C$-[[linear transformation|linear]] maps $P_n\to P_n$ [[generate an associative algebra|generated]] by the $\partial_i$. Since [[partial derivative|partial derivatives]] [[commute]] with each other, the [[algebra over a field|algebra]] $D_n$ is [[commutative]]. Elements of $D_n$ take the form $$u = \sum_{k_1,\dots,k_n \geq 0} c_{k_1,\dots,k_n} \frac{\partial^{k_1+\cdots + k_n}}{\partial x_1^{k_1}\cdots \partial x_n^{k_n}}$$ for $c_{k_1,\dots,k_n}\in\mathbb C$. This is the **algebra of polynomial differential operators in $n$ variables with constant coefficients**.

The $\mathbb C$-span of the $\partial_i$ is a [[vector subspace]] of $D_n$ given by the [[directional derivative|directional derivatives]] along $v\in \mathbb C^n$
