Let $U \subset \mathbb R^n$ be [[open]]. A function $f: U\to \mathbb R^m$ is **differentiable** at $a \in U$ if there exists a [[linear transformation]] $A:\mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R^m$ such that $$\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)-A(h)}{||h||} = 0.$$ The transformation $A$ is denoted $Df(a)$ and is called the **total derivative** of $f$ at $a$.
