The **special linear [[group]]** $\text{SL}(n,\mathbb C)$ (or, over the reals, $\text{SL}(n,\mathbb R)$) is the [[group]] of $n\times n$ complex (or real) valued matrices with [[determinant]] $1$ together with the [[binary operation|operation]] of [[matrix multiplication]].

This [[group]] is a [[matrix Lie group]] because it is a [[subgroup]] of the [[general linear group]] $\text{GL}(n,\mathbb C)$.
