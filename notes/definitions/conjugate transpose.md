The **[[complex conjugate|conjugate]] [[matrix transpose]]** of a complex $m\times n$ [[matrix]] $A$ is the $n \times m$ [[matrix]] $A^*$ given by taking the usual [[matrix transpose]] $A^T$ and then setting $A^*$ to be the [[matrix]] whose entries are the [[complex conjugate]] of each entry of $A^T$.
