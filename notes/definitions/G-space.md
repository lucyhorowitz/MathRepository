Let $G$ be a [[group]] and let $X$ be a [[topological space]]. Then $X$ is a **$G$-space** if it is a [[group action|G-set]] and the [[group action]] $G\times X\to X$ is [[continuous]]. 

The **orbit space** $X/G$ is the set of [[orbit|orbits]] $\{Gx\mid x\in X\}$ with [[topological space|topology]] given as the [[quotient of topological spaces]].

Note that in the case of a discrete [[group]] $G$, the [[continuous|continuity]] condition means that each action by an element of $G$ is a [[homeomorphism]].
