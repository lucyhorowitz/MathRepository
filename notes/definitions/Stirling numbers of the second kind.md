The **Stirling numbers of the second kind** count the number of ways to partition a set of $n$ distinct objects into $k$ indistinct sets, leaving none empty. They are denoted $S(n,k)$.

They also count the number of different [[equivalence relation|equivalence relations]] with exactly $k$ [[equivalence class|equivalence classes]] that can be defined on a set of size $n$.
