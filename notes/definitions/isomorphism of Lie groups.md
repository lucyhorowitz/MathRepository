Let $G$ and $H$ be [[Lie group|Lie groups]]. A map $\phi$ from $G$ to $H$ is an **isomorphism of Lie groups** if it is a [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] [[group homomorphism]]. Equivalently, $\Phi$ is an **isomorphism of Lie groups** if it is a [[bijective]] [[homomorphism of Lie groups]] with [[continuous]] [[inverse function|inverse]].
