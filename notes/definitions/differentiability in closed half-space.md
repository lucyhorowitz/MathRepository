Let $U\subset\mathbb H^n$ be [[open]] in the [[subspace topology]] on $H^n$ considered as a subset of $\mathbb R^n$. Then a function $f:U\to\mathbb R^m$ is **differentiable** if there is an open set $V \subset\mathbb R^n$ such that $U = V\cap H^n$ onto which we may extend $f$ to a [[differentiable]] function $f_V:V\to\mathbb R^n$.
