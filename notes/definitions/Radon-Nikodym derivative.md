Let $(X,\Sigma)$ be a [[measurable|measurable space]] with [[measure space|measures]] $\mu$ and $\nu$ such that $\nu$ is [[absolute continuity of measure|absolutely continuous]] with respect to $\mu$. The **Radon-Nikodym derivative** $\frac{\text d\nu}{\text d\mu}$ is the function $f \in$ [[Lp space|L]]$_1(\mu)$ such that $\nu(A) = \int_A f\text d\mu$.
