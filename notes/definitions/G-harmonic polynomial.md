Let $G$ be a [[subgroup]] of the [[general linear group]] $GL_n(\mathbb C)$ [[group action|acting]] naturally on $\mathbb C^n$. A [[polynomial ring|polynomial]] $f\in \mathbb C[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ is **$G$-harmonic** if it is annihilated by all $G$-[[G-invariant function|invariant]] [[algebra of polynomial differential operators|differential operators]] without constant term. That is, $f$ is $G$-harmonic if $u(f) = 0$ for all $u \in D^G_{>0}$.
