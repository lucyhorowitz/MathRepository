An **algebra over a [[field]]** $F$ is a [[vector space]] $U$ over $F$ with a [[multilinear|bilinear]] [[binary operation]] $U\times U \to U$ that is not necessarily [[associative]] but that follows left and right [[distributive|distributivity]].

One can loosen this definition and only require $F$ to be a [[commutative]] [[ring]].
