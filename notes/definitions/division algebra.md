A **division algebra** $D$  is an [[algebra over a field|algebra]] over the [[field]] $F$ such that for any element $a$ in $D$ and any non-zero element $b$ in $D$, there exists precisely one element $x\in D$ with $a=bx$ and precisely one element $y \in D$ such that $a=yb$.

If $D$ is an [[associative algebra]], then we just require that $D$ have an [[identity element]] under the [[binary operation]] and every nonzero element have a [[inverse element|multiplicative inverse]].
