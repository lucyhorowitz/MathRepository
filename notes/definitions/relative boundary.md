Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] and let $A$ be a [[subspace topology|subspace]] of $X$. A [[relative cycle]] $\alpha$ is trivial in the [[relative homology groups]] $H_n(X,A)$ if and only if it is a **relative boundary**, i.e. if $\alpha = \partial\beta + \gamma$ for some $\beta\in C_{n+1}(X)$ and $\gamma\in C_n(A)$.
