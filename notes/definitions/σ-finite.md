Let $(X,\Sigma, \mu)$ be a [[measure space]]. The [[measure space|measure]] $\mu$ is **Ïƒ-finite** if it satisfies one of the following equivalent criteria:
- $X$ can be covered with at most countably many (pairwise disjoint, this is not required) [[measurable]] sets of finite [[measure space|measure]];
- $X$ can be covered with a monotone sequence of [[measurable]] sets of finite [[measure space|measure]];
- There exists a positive [[measurable function]] $f$ whose [[Lebesgue integral|integral]] is finite.
