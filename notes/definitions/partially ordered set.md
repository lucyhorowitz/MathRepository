A **partially ordered set** is a set $X$ together with a [[homogeneous relation]] $\leq$ such that for all $x,y,z\in X$,
1. $\leq$ is [[reflexive]], i.e. $x\leq x$;
2. $\leq$ is [[antisymmetric]], i.e. if $x\leq y$ and $y\leq x$ then $x=y$;
3. $\leq$ is [[transitive]], i.e. if $x\leq y$ and $y\leq z$ then $x\leq z$.
