The **order** of an element $g$ of the [[group]] $G$ is the smallest integer $n \geq 1$ such that $g^n = e$, where $e$ is the [[group|group's]] [[identity element]]

Equivalently, this is the [[cardinal number]] of the [[cyclic group|cyclic]] [[subgroup]] of $G$ [[generating set of a group|generated]] by $g$ alone, if it exists.
