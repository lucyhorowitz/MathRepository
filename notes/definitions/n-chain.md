Let $X$ be a [[∆-complex]] and let $\Delta_n(X)$ be the [[free group|free]] [[abelian]] [[group]] on the [[open simplex|open]] [[n-simplex|n-simplices]] [[∆-complex is a disjoint union of open simplices|of]] $X$. Elements of $\Delta_n(X)$ are called **$n$-chains** and can be written as formal finite sums $$\sum_\alpha n_\alpha e_\alpha^n$$ for $n_\alpha \in \mathbb Z$.

Equivalently, this is sometimes written $$\sum_\alpha n_\alpha\sigma_\alpha$$ where the $\sigma_\alpha:\Delta^n\to X$ are the [[characteristic map of open simplex|characteristic maps]] of the $e_\alpha^n$. This sum can be thought of as a finite collection/chain of [[n-simplex|n-simplices]] in $X$ with integer multiplicities.
