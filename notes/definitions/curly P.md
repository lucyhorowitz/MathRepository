Let $\mathbb Q_p$ be the [[field]] of [[p-adic field|p-adic numbers]] under the $p$-adic [[absolute value]]. Define $$\mathcal P = \{x\in\mathbb Q_p\mid |x|_p< 1\}.$$ We call this **curly $\mathcal P$** because it has no other name that I have been able to find. It is a subset of the [[p-adic integers]], and in particular it is an [[open]] ball in the $p$-adic [[absolute value induces a topology|absolute value topology]] which means that [[every non-Archimedean ball is clopen|it is also]] [[closed]].

We can also define the "powers" of $\mathcal P$ by $$\mathcal P^n = \{x\in\mathbb Q_p\mid |x_p|<p^{-k}\}.$$
#todo find a better name for this!!!
