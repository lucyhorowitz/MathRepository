A **partition** $P$ of a [[closed]] [[interval]] $[a,b]$ is a finite collection of points in $[a,b]$ such that $a,b \in P$.

More generally, a **partition** $P$ of a [[rectangle]] $Q$ in $\mathbb R^n$ is a collection $P = \{P_i\}_{i=1}^n$ of partitions of the [[component interval|component intervals]] $[a_i,b_i]$ of $Q$.
