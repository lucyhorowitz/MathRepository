A sequence of [[group homomorphism|homomorphisms]] $$\cdots \to A_{n+1}\to A_n \to A_{n-1}\to \cdots$$ where the arrow between $A_{k+1}$ and $A_{k}$ is labelled $\alpha_{k+1}$ is an **exact sequence** if the [[kernel of group homomorphism|kernel]] of $\alpha_k$ is equal to the [[image]] of $\alpha_{k+1}$. That is, if $$\text{Ker}(\alpha_n) = \text{Im}(\alpha_{n+1}).$$
Equivalently, an **exact sequence** is a [[chain complex]] whose [[homology group|homology groups]] are all trivial.
