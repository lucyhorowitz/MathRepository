Let $U\subset\mathbb R^n$ be an [[open]] set. A **differential $k$-form** on $U$ is a map to the $k$th [[exterior power of a vector space|exterior product]] of the [[dual space]] of $\mathbb R^n$: $$\phi:U\to\wedge^k((\mathbb R^n)^*).$$

A $0$-form is just a function. Wedging a $0$-form with something amounts to multiplication by the function.

Let $U\subset\mathbb R^n$ be an [[open]] set. Then we write $\mathcal A^k(U)$ for the [[vector space]] of [[differential k-form|k-forms]] on $U$.
