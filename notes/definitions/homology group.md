Consider a [[chain complex]] with [[abelian]] [[group|groups]] $C_i$ and [[group homomorphism|homomorphisms]] $\partial_i$. Because $\partial_{k+1}\circ\partial_k = 0$ for all $k$, the [[image]] of $\partial_{k=1}$ is a subset of the [[kernel of group homomorphism|kernel]] of $\partial_k$: $$\text{Im}(\partial_{k+1})\subset \text{Ker}(\partial_k).$$ The $n$th **homology group** of the chain complex is the [[quotient by subgroup|quotient group]] $$H_n = \text{Ker}(\partial_n)/\text{Im}(\partial_{n+1}).$$ 

Elements of $\text{Ker}(\partial_n)$ are called **cycles** and elements of $\text{Im}(\partial_{n+1})$ are called **boundaries**.
