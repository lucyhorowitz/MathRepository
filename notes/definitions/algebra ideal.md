An **ideal** $I$ of an [[algebra over a field|algebra]] $A$ is a subset $I\subset A$ that is both a [[left algebra ideal]] and a [[right algebra ideal]]. In the case that $A$ is a [[commutative]] [[algebra over a field|algebra]], these notions coincide and every right ideal is also a left ideal is also a two-sided ideal.

As long as the [[ring]] $R$ is not a [[rng]], $A$ will inherit the definition of [[ring ideal|ideal]] from its [[algebras are rings|underlying ring structure]].
