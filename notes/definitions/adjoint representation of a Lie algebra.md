Let $\mathfrak g$ be a [[Lie algebra]]. Then the [[adjoint map of a Lie algebra|adjoint map]] $\text{ad}:\mathfrak g \to \mathfrak{gl}(\mathfrak g)$ is given by $$\text{ad}_X(Y) = [X,Y].$$ Because the [[adjoint map is a Lie algebra homomorphism]], it is a [[Lie algebra representation|representation]] of $\mathfrak g$, and therefore we may refer to $\text{ad}$ as the **adjoint representation of $\mathfrak g$.
