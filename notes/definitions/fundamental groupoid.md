The **fundamental [[groupoid]]** $\Pi(X)$ of a [[topological space]] $X$ is the [[category]] whose objects are the points of $X$ and whose morphisms $x\to y$ are the [[homotopy equivalence of paths|equivalence classes of paths]] from $x$ to $y$. 

Note that this means that the set of [[endomorphism|endomorphisms]] of an object $x$ in $\Pi(X)$ is exactly the [[fundamental group]] $\pi_1(X)$. 

The fundamental groupoid may be thought of as a [[functor]] from the [[category of topological spaces]] to the [[category of groupoids]].
