Let $G$ be a [[group]] with [[subgroup]] $H$. Then the **quotient** $G/H$ is the  [[cosets partition group|set]] of [[equivalence class|classes]] of [[left coset|cosets]] $gH$ for $g\in G$. The quotient is itself a [[subgroup]] exactly when $H$ is [[normal subgroup|normal]] in $G$. See [[quotient by normal subgroup]].
