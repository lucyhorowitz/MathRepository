Let $G$ be a [[compact]] [[topological group]] and let $dg$ be a [[Haar measure]] on $G$. The **$L^2$-inner product** on $C(G)$, the space of [[continuous]] functions $G\to \mathbb C$, is a [[Hermitian inner product]] given by $$\langle f_1,f_2\rangle = \frac{1}{\text{vol}(G)}\int_G f_1(g)\overline{f_2(g)}\text dg$$ for any $f_1,f_2\in C(G)$. The integral is the [[Haar integral]] and the [[volume of compact topological space|volume]] of $G$ is the integral of the constant function $1$ over $G$.
