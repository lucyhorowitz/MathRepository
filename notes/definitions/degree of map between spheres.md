Let $f:S^n\to S^n$ be a function. The [[continuous functions induce homomorphisms on homology groups|induced homomorphism]] $f_*: \tilde H_n(S^n)\to \tilde H_n(S^n)$ [[reduced homology of the sphere|is]] a [[group homomorphism|homomorphism]] from an infinite [[cyclic group]] to itself. [[classification of group homomorphisms Z to G|Thus it must be]] of the form $f_*(\alpha) = d\alpha$ for some integer $d$ depending only on $f$. The integer $d$ is the **degree** of $f$.
