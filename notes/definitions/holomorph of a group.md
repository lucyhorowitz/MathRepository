The **holomorph** of a [[group]] $G$ is in some sense a [[group]] that contains a copy of both $G$ itself and the [[automorphism group]] of $G$. 

Formally, $\text{Hol}(G) = G\rtimes \text{Aut}(G)$ where the [[group homomorphism|homomorphism]] $\rho: \text{Aut}(G)\to \text{Aut}(G)$ associated to the [[semidirect product]] is the [[identity function]]. Thus the product of elements of $\text{Hol}(G)$ is as follows:
$$(g,\alpha)(h,\beta) = (g\alpha(h),\alpha\beta).$$

Equivalently, we can define $\text{Hol}(G) =\{l_g\circ\sigma \mid g\in G, \sigma\in\text{Aut}(G)\}\subset S_G$ where $l_g$ denotes left multiplication by $g$.
