A **chain complex** is a sequence of [[group homomorphism|homomorphisms]] of [[abelian]] [[group|groups]] $$\cdots \to C_{n+1} \to C_n \to C_{n-1} \to \cdots \to C_1\to C_0 \to 0$$ (where the arrow between $C_{k}$ and $C_{k-1}$ is labelled $\partial_k$) such that the composition $\partial_{k+1}\circ\partial_k = 0$ for all $k$.
