The **radical** of a [[Lie algebra]] $L$ is the maximal [[solvable Lie algebra|solvable]] [[ideal of a Lie algebra|ideal]] of $L$. 
## Proof of existence
Let $L$ be a [[Lie algebra]] and suppose that $S$ is a maximal [[solvable Lie algebra|solvable]] [[ideal of a Lie algebra|ideal]] of $L$ (i.e. that it is not contained in any other solvable ideal). Then for any other [[solvable Lie algebra|solvable]] [[ideal of a Lie algebra|ideal]] $I$ of $L$, $I+S$ [[sum of Lie algebra ideals is an ideal|is an ideal]] and [[sum of solvable ideals is solvable|is solvable]]. Thus either $I+S = S$ or $I\subset S$.
