Let $X$ be a [[topological space]]. The $n$th **reduced homology group** of $X$, denoted $\tilde H_n(X)$, is the $n$th [[homology group]] of the [[chain complex]] $$\cdots \to C_2(X) \to C_1(x) \to C_0(X) \to \mathbb Z\to 0$$ where the maps between the [[group|groups]] $C_i$ of [[n-chain|n-chains]] are the usual [[boundary homomorphism|boundary homomorphisms]] and the map (call it $\varepsilon$) $C_0(X)\to \mathbb Z$ is given by $$\varepsilon\left(\sum_i n_i\sigma_i\right) = \sum_i n_i.$$

Reduced homology groups are introduced so that a [[singular homology of a point|point has trivial homology group]] for all values of $n$ including zero.
