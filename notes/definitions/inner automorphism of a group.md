Let $G$ be a [[group]] and let $g\in G$. Define a [[group homomorphism|homomorphism]] $\varphi_g: G\to G$ by $\varphi_g(x) = gxg^{-1}$ for all $x\in G$. These $\varphi_g$ are in fact [[automorphism|automorphisms]] and moreover $\varphi_g\circ\varphi_h = \varphi_{gh}$. The $\varphi_g$ are called **inner automorphisms** of $G$.
