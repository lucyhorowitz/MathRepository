Let $R$ be a [[ring]] and $I$ an [[ring ideal|ideal]] in $R$. Define an [[equivalence relation]] $\sim$ on $R$ by $a\sim b$ when $a-b \in I$. The [[equivalence class|equivalence classes]] are given by $[a] = a+ I = \{a+r \mid r\in I\}$. The set of all such equivalence classes is denoted $R/I$, or the **quotient of $R$ by $I$**.  The operations addition ($(a+I)+ (b+I) = (a+b)+I$) and multiplication ($(a+I)(b+I) = (ab)+I$) are [[well-defined]]. #write_proof 

Moreover, this itself is a [[ring]] #write_proof.

The quotient comes with a [[surjective]] [[ring homomorphism|homomorphism]] $R\to R/I$ given by $r\mapsto r+I$.
