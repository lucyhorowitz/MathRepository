Let $G$ and $G'$ be [[compact]] [[topological group|topological groups]] with respective [[Haar integral|Haar integrals]] $\int_G$ and $\int_{G'}$. For [[continuous]] functions $f,f':G,G'\to \mathbb C$, denote by $f\boxtimes f':G\times G \to \mathbb C$ the function such that $(g,g')\mapsto f(g)f'(g')$. From this and given [[continuous group representation|continuous]] [[group representation|representations]] $\rho:G\to GL(V)$ and $\rho':G\to GL(V')$, we can define the **box product of representations** into the [[tensor product of vector spaces|tensor product]] of $V$ and $V'$ as $$\rho\boxtimes \rho' :G\times G \to GL(V\otimes V')$$ given by $(g,g')\mapsto \rho(g) \otimes \rho'(g')$.
