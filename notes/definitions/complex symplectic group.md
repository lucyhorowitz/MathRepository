The **complex symplectic group** $\text{Sp}(2n,\mathbb C)$ is the [[group]] of $2n\times 2n$complex-valued [[matrix|matrices]] that preserve the [[form]] $\omega$ as in the definition of the [[real symplectic group]].

This [[group]] is a [[matrix Lie group]] because it is a [[subgroup]] of the [[general linear group]] $\text{GL}(n,\mathbb C)$.
