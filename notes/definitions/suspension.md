Consider the circle $S^1$ as the unit [[interval]] [[quotient of topological spaces|quotient]] by its [[boundary]]: $$S^1= I/\partial I.$$ Denote its basepooint by $1$. Then the **reduced suspension** of a [[based topological space|based]] [[topological space]] $X$ is the [[smash product]] $$\Sigma X = X\wedge S^1.$$ Explicitly, $$\Sigma X = (X\times S^1)/((\{*\}\times S^1)\cup (X\times\{1\})).$$

The usual **suspension** is done without [[quotient of topological spaces|identifying]] the line $\{*\}\times I$ through the basepoint of $X$ to a point.
