### MATH 20700 version
A **projection** is a [[linear transformation]] $P:V\to W$ between [[vector space|vector spaces]] $V$ and $W$ such that $P^2 = P$. That is, $P$ is [[idempotent]] when considered as an element of the [[ring]] of [[linear transformation|linear transformations]].

## MATH 32500 version
Let $F$ be a [[subspace topology|subspace]] of a [[vector space]] $E$. Then a [[linear transformation]] $P:E\to E$ is a **projection** onto $F$ if 
1. $P_{|F} = \text{id}_F$. That is, if the [[restriction]] of $P$ to $F$ is equal to the [[identity function]] on $F$, and
2. $\text{im}(P) \subseteq F$. In particular the [[image]] is actually equal to $F$, but the condition is sufficient.
