A **projection** is a [[linear transformation]] $P:V\to W$ between [[vector space|vector spaces]] $V$ and $W$ such that $P^2 = P$. That is, $P$ is [[idempotent]] when considered as an element of the [[ring]] of [[linear transformation|linear transformations]].

Equivalently, for $V'$ a [[vector subspace|subspace]] of a [[vector space]] $V$, a [[linear transformation]] $P:V\to V$ is a **projection** onto $V'$ if 
1. $P_{|V'} = \text{id}_V'$. That is, if the [[restriction]] of $P$ to $V'$ is equal to the [[identity function]] on $V'$, and
2. $\text{im}(P) \subseteq V'$. In particular the [[image]] is actually equal to $V'$, but the condition is sufficient.
