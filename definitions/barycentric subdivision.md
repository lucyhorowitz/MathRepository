The **barycentric subdivision** of an [[n-simplex]] $[v_0,\dots,v_n]$ is the decomposition of $[v_0,\dots,v_n]$ into the [[n-simplex|n-simplices]] $[b,w_0,\dots,w_{n-1}]$ where we have by [[induction]] $[w_0,\dots, w_{n-1}]$ an $(n-1)$-[[n-simplex|simplex]] in the barycentric subdivision of a [[face of an n-simplex|face]] $[v_0,\dots,\hat v_i,\dots,v_n]$. The [[induction]] starts at $n=0$ where we define the barycentric subdivision of $[v_0]$ to be $[v_0]$. It's not too hard to see the cases $n=1,2,3$.

The vertices of the barycentric subdivision of $[v_0,\dots,v_n]$ are thus the [[barycenter|barycenters]] of all of the $k$-dimensional [[face of an n-simplex|faces]] $[v_{i_0},\dots, v_{i_k}]$ of $[v_0,\dots,v_n]$ for $0\leq k\leq n$.  The barycenter of this face has [[barycentric coordinates]] $t_i = \frac{1}{(k+1)}$ for $i= i_0,\dots, i_k$ and $t_i=0$ otherwise.

The [[n-simplex|n-simplices]] of the barycentric subdivision of the standard [[n-simplex]] $\Delta^n$ with all of their [[face of an n-simplex|faces]] form a [[âˆ†-complex]] and even a [[simplicial complex]] structure on $\Delta^n
