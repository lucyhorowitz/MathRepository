A [[game]] in **normal form** is a triplet $$G = (I, \{S_i\}_{i\in I}, \{h_i\}_{i\in I})$$ where 
1. $I$ is the set of _players_. $I = \{1,\dots, n\}$ for some $n \in\mathbb N$.
2. for each $i \in I$, $S_i$ is player $i$'s set of [[strategy|strategies]]. $\prod\limits_{i\in I} S_i$ is the set of [[strategy profile|strategy profiles]]
3. for each $i\in I$, the function $h_i: S_i \to \mathbb R$ is the [[payoff function]] for player $i$.
