The **Baire classes** of [[continuous]] real-valued functions on a [[topological space]] $X$ are defined as follows:
- [[continuous]] functions are Baire-0;
- functions that are the [[pointwise convergence|pointwise limit]] of a sequence of [[continuous]] functions are Baire-1;
- for all $\alpha \in \mathbb N$, functions that are the [[pointwise convergence|pointwise limit]] of a sequence functions of Baire class less than $\alpha$ are Baire-$\alpha$.
