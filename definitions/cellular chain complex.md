Let $X$ be a [[CW complex]]. Then by [[relative homology of n-skeletons of CW complexes|These]] [[kth homology group of n-skeleton is zero when k > n|three]] [[inclusion of n-skeleton in CW complex induces isomorphism between kth homology groups for k < n|results]], we can write parts of the [[long exact sequence of a pair|long exact sequences]] of the [[exact sequence on reduced homology of space and retractable subspace|pairs]] $(X^{n+1}, X^n)$, $(X^n, X^{n-1})$, and $(X^{n-1}, X^{n-2})$ of the $n$-skeleta of $X$ can be written in the [[commutative diagram]] of the [[homology group|homology groups]] and [[relative homology groups]] ![[Screen Shot 2021-12-02 at 11.12.04 AM.png]] where $d_{n+1}$ and $d_n$ are the compositions $j_n\partial_{n+1}$ and $j_{n-1}\partial_n$, which in turn are "relativizations" of the [[boundary homomorphism|boundary maps]] $\partial_n$ and $\partial_{n+1}$. 

The composition $d_nd_{n+1}$ is zero because the [[composition of consecutive boundary homomorphisms is 0]]. The horizontal. part of this diagram is therefore a [[chain complex]] called the **cellular chain complex** of $X$. 

Because $H_n(X^n, X^{n-1})$ is [[free group|free]] with [[basis for abelian group|basis]] in [[bijective|bijection]] with $n$-cells of $X$, we can think of its elements as linear combinations of $n$-cells of $X$.
