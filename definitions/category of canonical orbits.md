Let $G$ be a [[group]]. The **category of canonical orbits** of $G$, denoted $\mathcal O(G)$, is the [[category]] with objects the [[action of a group on quotient by subgroup|G-sets]] $G/H$ for all [[subgroup|subgroups]] $H$ of $G$ and morphisms the [[equivariant map|G-maps]] that exist between the objects.

$\mathcal O(G)$ is [[isomorphism of categories|isomorphic]] to the [[category]] $\mathcal G$ whose objects are the [[subgroup|subgroups]] of $G$ and whose morphisms are the distinct sub[[conjugacy classes|conjugacy]] relations $\gamma^{-1}H\gamma \subset K$ for $\gamma \in G$. 

## Proof
#write_proof  [[G-equivariant homomorphisms between quotient G-sets]] [[Weyl group of stabilizer under transitive action isomorphic to G-automorphisms of G-set]]
