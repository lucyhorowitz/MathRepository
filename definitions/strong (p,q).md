Let $(X,\Sigma,\mu)$ and $(Y,T,\nu)$  be [[measure space|measure spaces]] and let $T: L_1(X,\mu) \to L_1(Y,\nu)$ be an operator that maps [[measurable function|measurable functions]] on $X$ to measurable functions on $Y$.  Let $1\leq p,q\leq \infty$. Then $T$ is of **type strong $(p,q)$** if there exists a constant $c > 0$ such that $||Tf||_q \leq c||f||_p$. This immediately implies that
1. $T$ is a [[bounded function|bounded]] operator.
2. [[weak (p,q)|Weak]] $(p,\infty)$ is equivalent to strong $(p,\infty)$.
