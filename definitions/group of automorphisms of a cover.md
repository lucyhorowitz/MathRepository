In the [[category of coverings of groupoids]], let $\text{Aut}(\mathcal E) \subset \text{Cov}(\mathcal E,\mathcal E)$ denote the [[group]] of [[automorphism|automorphisms]] [[map of covering of groupoid|of]] $\mathcal E$. 

Note that there do exist [[map of covering of groupoid|maps]] $g:\mathcal E\to \mathcal E$ that are not isomorphisms because in general, we may have one [[conjugate subgroups|conjugate subgroup]] be a proper [[subgroup]] of another.
