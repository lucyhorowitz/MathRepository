Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] and let $f,g:I\to X$ be two [[path|paths]] in $X$ such that $f(0) = g(0) = x$ and $f(1) = g(1)=y$. That is, $f$ and $g$ are both [[path|paths]] *from* $x$ *to* $y$ in $X$. Then $f$ and $g$ are said to be **homotopically equivalent** if there exists a [[homotopy]]  $h: I\times I \to X$ such that
1. $h(s,0) = f(s)$;
2. $h(s,1) = g(s)$;
3. $h(0,t) = x$;
4. $h(1,t) = y$.

Homotopy equivalence of paths forms an [[equivalence relation]] on [[path|paths]] in $X$.
