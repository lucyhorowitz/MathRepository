The **compact symplectic group** $\text{Sp}(n)$ is the [[group]] intersection of the [[complex symplectic group]] $\text{Sp}(2n,\mathbb C)$ and the [[unitary group]] $\text{U}(2n)$: $$\text{Sp}(n) = \text{Sp}(2n,\mathbb C)\cap\text{U}(2n).$$

This [[group]] is a [[matrix Lie group]] because it is a [[subgroup]] of the [[general linear group]] $\text{GL}(n,\mathbb C)$.
