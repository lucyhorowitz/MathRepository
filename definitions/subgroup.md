A subset $H\subset G$ of the [[group]] $G$ is a **subgroup** of $G$ if it is itself a [[group]] under the [[binary operation|operation]] inherited from $G$.

The **subgroup axioms** are
- closure under $*$;
- the [[identity element]] of $G$ is in $H$;
- for every $h\in H$, the [[inverse element]] $h^{-1}$ is also in $H$.
