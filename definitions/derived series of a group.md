The **derived series** of a [[group]] $G$ is the descending series of consecutive [[commutator subgroup|derived subgroups]] of $G$: $$G = G^{(0)} \supseteq G^{(1)} = [G,G] \supseteq \cdots \supseteq G^{(i)}\supseteq \cdots$$ where $G^{(i+1)} = [G^{(i)},G^{(i)}]$. Note that this series may not reach the trivial subgroup.
