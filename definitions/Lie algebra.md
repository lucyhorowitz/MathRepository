Let $(L,F)$ be a [[vector space]] with a [[binary operation]] $L\times L \to L$ denoted $(x,y) \mapsto [xy]$. This operation is called the **bracket** or **commutator** of $x$ and $y$. The vector space together with the operation is a **Lie algebra** over the [[field]] $F$ if 
1. The bracket operation is [[multilinear|bilinear]];
2. $[xx] = 0$ for all $x \in L$;
3. $[x[yz]] + [y[zx]]+[z[xy]] =0$ for all $x,y,z\in L$.

The last axiom is called the **Jacobi identity**.
