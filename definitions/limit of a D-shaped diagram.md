The **limit** of a [[D-shaped diagram]] is given by reversing the arrows in the definition of the [[colimit of a D-shaped diagram|colimit]] of the same [[D-shaped diagram]]:

Then $\lim F$ is an [[category|object]] of $\mathcal C$  together with a morphism of diagrams $\pi:\underline{\lim F} \to F$ that is [[terminal object|terminal]] among all such morphisms. That is, if $\varepsilon:\underline A\to F$ is a morphism of diagrams, then there is a unique morphism $\tilde \varepsilon: A\to \lim F$ in $\mathcal C$ such that $\pi\circ \tilde\varepsilon = \varepsilon$. The following [[commutative diagram|diagram commutes]]:
