Let $G$ be a [[group]] [[group action|acting]] on a set $X$. The **orbit** of some $x \in X$  is the set of elements of $X$ to which $x$ can be moved by the elements of $G$. It is denoted $$G\cdot x = \{g\cdot x \mid g \in G\}.$$

The set of orbits of points of $X$ creates a partition of $X$ with associated [[equivalence relation]] given by $x\sim y$ if and only if there exists $g \in G$ with $g\cdot x =y$, and the orbits are [[equivalence class|equivalence classes]].

Equivalently, an **orbit** of $x$ is the subset of $X$ containing $x$ on which the action of $G$ is [[transitive group action|transitive]].
