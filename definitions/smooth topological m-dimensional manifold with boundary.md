A **smooth topological $m$-dimensional manifold with boundary** is a [[topological m-dimensional manifold with boundary]] $M$ together with a collection $\mathcal A$ of [[chart|charts]] on $M$ such that 
1. for all $p\in M$, there exists a [[chart]] $(U, \phi)\in \mathcal A$ such that $p \in U$;
2. for any two [[chart|charts]] $(U,\phi)$ and $(V, \psi) \in \mathcal A$, the [[transition function]] $$\psi\circ \phi^{-1}:\phi(U\cap V)\to\psi(U\cap V)$$ is a [[smooth]] [[diffeomorphism]].
3. the set $\mathcal A$ (called an [[atlas]]) is the maximal set of collections of [[chart|charts]] satisfying 1. and 2.
