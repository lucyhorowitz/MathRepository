The **special linear [[group]]** $\text{SL}(n,\mathbb C)$ (or, over the reals, $\text{SL}(n,\mathbb R)$) is the [[group]] of $n\times n$ complex (or real) valued matrices with [[determinant]] $1$ together with the [[binary operation|operation]] of [[matrix multiplication]].

This [[group]] is a [[matrix Lie group]] because it is a [[subgroup]] of the [[general linear group]] $\text{GL}(n,\mathbb C)$.

### Proof that it is a [[group]]
- The group is closed under [[matrix multiplication]]: By the [[multiplicity of the determinant]], if $A,B$ are in $\text{SL}(n,\mathbb C)$, then so is $AB$. 
- We know that [[matrix multiplication]] is [[associative]].
- The [[determinant]] of the [[identity matrix]] is $1$, so $\text{SL}(n,\mathbb C)$ has an [[identity element]]. 
- Because the [[determinant]] of the [[inverse matrix|inverse]] [[determinant of inverse is inverse of determinant|is]] the inverse of the [[determinant]], if $A \in \text{SL}(n,\mathbb C)$, then so is $A^{-1}$.
