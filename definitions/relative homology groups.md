Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] and let $A$ be a [[subspace topology|subspace]] of $X$. Define a [[chain complex]] whose elements are the [[quotient by subgroup|quotients]] $C_n(X,A) = C_n(X)/C_n(A)$ of elements of the [[chain complex]] on the [[group|groups]] of [[singular n-chain|n-chains]] of $X$ and $A$, respectively. 

Note that [[n-chain|chains]] in $A$ are trivial in $C_n(X,A)$. 

The [[boundary homomorphism]] $\partial:C_n(X)\to C_{n-1}(X)$ sends $C_n(A)$ to $C_{n-1}(A)$, so it induces a [[quotient vector space|quotient]] boundary map $\partial: C_n(X,A)\to C_{n-1}(X,A)$. The requisite relation in which composition of consecutive [[boundary homomorphism|boundary maps]] is zero is met because it is met before taking the [[quotient by subgroup|quotient]]. 

The [[homology group|homology groups]] of this [[chain complex]] are called the **relative homology groups** $H_n(X,A)$.
