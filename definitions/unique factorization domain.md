An [[integral domain]] $R$ is a **unique factorization domain** if
1. Every nonzero, non-[[unit of a ring|unit]] $r\in R$ can be written as a product of [[irreducible element of an integral domain|irreducibles]]; and
2. Whenever $p_1\cdots p_n=q_1\cdots q_m$ for $p_i,q_j$ [[irreducible element of an integral domain|irreducible]] and $m,n\in\mathbb N$, then $m=n$ and there is a relabeling/reordering of the $q_j$ such that $q_i$ is [[associate elements in an integral domain|associate]] to $p_i$ for all $1\leq i\leq n$.

In particular, for every [[associate elements in an integral domain|association]] [[equivalence class|class]] of [[irreducible element of an integral domain|irreducibles]], we can choose a representative, and let $P$ be the collection of such representatives so that every $r\in R$ can be written uniquely as $$r= u\prod_{p\in P} p^{e_p}$$ for $u$ a [[unit of a ring|unit]] and all but finitely many of the $e_p$ equal to zero.
