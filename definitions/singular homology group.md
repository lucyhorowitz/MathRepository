Consider a [[topological space]] $X$ and consider the [[chain complex]] given by the groups of [[singular n-chain|singular n-chains]] of $X$. The $n$th [[homology group]] $\text{Ker}(\partial_{n})/\text{Im}(\partial_{n+1})$ is denoted $H_n(X)$ and is called the $n$th **singular homology group** of $X$.
