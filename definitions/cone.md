Let $X$ be a [[based topological space|based]] [[topological space]] and let $I$ be the unit [[interval]]. The **reduced cone** on $X$ is the [[smash product]] $$CX = X\wedge I$$ where $I$ has as its basepoint $1$. Explicitly, $$CX = (X\times I)/((\{*\}\times I) \cup (X\times\{1\})).$$ 

The usual **cone** is done without [[quotient of topological spaces|identifying]] the line $\{*\}\times I$ through the basepoint of $X$ to a point.
