Let $X$ and $Y$ be [[topological space|topological spaces]]. Then a [[continuous]] function $f:X\to Y$ is a **homotopy equivalence** if there exists a [[continuous]] function $g:Y\to X$ such that both $f\circ g$ and $g\circ f$ are [[homotopy|homotopic]] to the respective [[identity function|identity functions]] on the domain. 

The spaces $X$ and $Y$ are said to be **homotopy equivalent** or to have the same **homotopy type**. Homotopy equivalence is an [[equivalence relation]].
