An $n\times n$ real [[matrix]] $A$ is **orthogonal** if its column vectors (equivalently, its row vectors) are [[orthonormal]]. That is, the [[matrix multiplication|product]] of $A$ with its [[matrix transpose|transpose]] $A^T$ is equal to the [[identity matrix]] $I_n$: $$AA^T = A^TA = I_n$$
Equivalently, the [[matrix transpose|transpose]] of an **orthogonal** [[matrix]] $A$ is equal to its [[inverse matrix|inverse]]: $A^T = A^{-1}$.
