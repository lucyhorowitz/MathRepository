Let $R$ be a [[commutative]] [[ring]] and let $a,b\in R$. An element $d\in R$ is a **greatest common divisor** of $a$ and $b$ if $d$ [[division in a ring|divides]] $a$ and $d$ [[division in a ring|divides]] $b$ and for every $d'\in R$ such that $d'$ [[division in a ring|divides]] $a$ and $d'$[[division in a ring|divides]] $b$, we have that $d'$ [[division in a ring|divides]] $d$. 

Equivalently, $d$ is a **greatest common divisor** of $a$ and $b$ if the [[ring ideal|ideal]] [[generate a ring ideal|generated]] by $d$ is the smallest [[principal ideal]] that contains both $a$ and $b$. This [[ring ideal|ideal]] is unique.
