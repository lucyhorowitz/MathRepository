Let $m< n$. Then an **$m$-dimensional smooth manifold embedded in $\mathbb R^n$ with boundary** is a subset $M \subset\mathbb R^n$ such that for all points $p \in M$, there exists an [[open]] set $U \subset H^k$ the [[closed half-space]] and an [[subspace topology|open]] neighborhood $V \subset M$ of $p$ and a map $\phi: U \to V$ such that 
1. $\phi$ is a [[homeomorphism]]
2. $\phi$ is [[smooth]] in $H^k$ ( #todo: what is this exactly?)
3. the [[differentiable|total derivative]] $D\phi(x)$ has rank $m$ for all $x \in U$.
