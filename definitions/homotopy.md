$I$ denotes the unit [[interval]] $[0,1]$.
### [[Algebraic Topology|Hatcher]] version
Let $X$ and $Y$ be [[topological space|topological spaces]]. A **homotopy** is a family of [[continuous]] functions $f_t:X\to Y$ for $t\in I$ such that the associated map $F:X\times I\to Y$ given by $F(x,t) = f_t(x)$ is [[continuous]].

Two maps $f_0,f_1:X\to Y$ are **homotopic** if there exists a homotopy $f_t$ connecting them.

### [[A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology|Concise]] version
Let $X$ and $Y$ be [[topological space|topological spaces]]. A **homotopy** between two [[continuous]] functions $p,q:X\to Y$ is a [[continuous]] function $h: X\times I\to Y$ such that $h(x,0) = p(x)$ and $h(x,1) = q(x)$.
