Let $f:X\to Y$ be a [[continuous]] function between [[topological space|topological spaces]] $X$ and $Y$. Let $C_n(X)$ and $C_n(Y)$ be the [[group|groups]] of [[n-chain|n-chains]] in the [[chain complex]] of $X$ and $Y$, respectively. Then we may define a [[group homomorphism|homomorphism]] called a **chain map** $f_\sharp:C_n(X)\to C_n(Y)$ by composing each [[singular n-simplex]] $\sigma:\Delta^n\to X$ with $f$ to get a [[singular n-simplex]] $f_\sharp(\sigma) = f\sigma:\Delta^n\to Y$ and extending $f_\sharp$ [[linear transformation|linearly]] via $$f_\sharp\left(\sum_i n_i\sigma_i\right) = \sum_i n_if_\sharp(\sigma_i) = \sum_i n_if_\sharp\sigma_i.$$

Let $\partial$ be a general [[boundary homomorphism]] between $C_{k+1}(X)$ and $C_{k}(X)$ and sim. for  $Y$. Then the maps $f_\sharp:C_n(X)\to C_n(Y)$ satisfy $f_\sharp \partial = \partial f_\sharp$ and the following diagram [[commitative diagram|commutes]]:
