Let $1\leq p < \infty$ and let $(X,\Sigma, \mu)$ be a [[measure space]]. Let $F$ be the set of functions $f: X\to \mathbb R$ such that $$||f||_p = \left(\int_X|f|^p\text d\mu\right)^{1/p}\ < \infty$$ where $||f||_p$ is the [[p-norm]]. Equivalently, $F$ is the set of functions such that the $p$th power of their absolute value is [[Lebesgue integral|integrable]]. Let $N = \{f \in F \mid f = 0$ [[almost everywhere]]$\}$. Because [[zero integral of a nonnegative function|the integral of a positive function is zero if and only if it is zero almost everywhere]], we have that $N$ is the [[kernel of linear transformation|kernel]] of the [[p-norm]]. The [[normed linear space]] given by the [[quotient vector space]] of $F$ by $N$ is $L_p(X,\mu)$.

For $p = \infty$, consider the set $G$ of functions $f:X \to \mathbb R$  for which there exists $c \in\mathbb R$ such that $\mu(\{|f| > c\}) = 0$ and take the [[quotient vector space]] of this set by the [[equivalence relation]] $\sim$ on $G$ given by $f\sim g$ if $f(x) = g(x)$ [[almost everywhere]] on $X$.  This space with the [[essential supremum]] of $f$ as the [[norm]] is $L_\infty(X,\mu)$.
