aliases: covering homotopy property

Let $E$ and $B$ be [[compactly generated]] [[topological space|topological spaces]]. A [[surjective]] [[continuous]] function $p:E\to B$ is a **fibration** if it satisfies the **[[covering space|coveirng]] [[homotopy]] property**. That is, given the diagram ![[Screen Shot 2022-02-25 at 10.43.45 PM.png]] where $Y$ is any [[compactly generated]] [[topological space]], $f:Y\to E$ is some [[continuous]] function, $h:Y\times I\to B$ is a [[homotopy]], and $i_0(y) = (y,0)$, if $h\circ i_0 = p\circ f$, then there exists $\tilde h$ that makes the diagram [[commutative diagram|commute]]. 

The diagram can also be written as ![[Screen Shot 2022-02-25 at 11.05.02 PM.png]] where $X^I$ is the set of ( #todo: [[continuous]]? is this even what that is?) functions $I\to B$ for $I$ the unit [[interval]] and $p_0(\beta) = \beta(0)$ for $\beta\in B^I$.
