Let $G$ be a finitely [[generating set of a group|generated]] [[abelian]] [[group]]. By the  [[Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups]], $G$ may be uniquely written as a [[direct sum of groups|direct sum]] of [[cyclic group|cyclic groups]]. The **rank** of $G$ is the number of $\mathbb Z$ summands in this expression.
