A **Î”-complex** is a [[quotient vector space]] of a collection of disjoint [[n-simplex|simplices]] obtained by identifying certain [[face of an n-simplex|faces]] by the canonical [[linear transformation|linear]] [[homeomorphism|homeomorphisms]] described in the definition of [[barycentric coordinates]].

Consider a collection of [[n-simplex|n-simplices]] $\Delta^n_\alpha$ of various dimension (i.e. $n$ is not fixed) and some sets $\mathcal F_i$ of [[face of an n-simplex|faces]] of the $\Delta_\alpha^n$ such that within each $\mathcal F_i$, each [[face of an n-simplex|face]] has the same dimension (i.e. value for $n$). We can take a [[quotient vector space]] of the disjoint union $\coprod_\alpha \Delta_\alpha^n$ by [[equivalence relation|identifying]] all of the [[face of an n-simplex|faces]] in each $\mathcal F_i$ via the canonical [[linear transformation|linear]] [[homeomorphism|homeomorphisms]] described in the definition of [[barycentric coordinates]].
