A **homeomorphism** between two [[topological space|topological spaces]] $X$ and $Y$ is a function $f: X\to Y$ such that 
1. $f$ is [[continuous]].
2. $f$ is [[bijective]].
3. $f^{-1}:Y\to X$ is [[continuous]].

Two [[topological space|topological spaces]] $X$ and $Y$ are **homeomorphic** if there exists a homeomorphism between them.
