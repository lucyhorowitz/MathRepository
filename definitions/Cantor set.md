The **Cantor set** $\mathcal C$ is constructed from the unit [[interval]] as follows:

Let $C_n = \frac{C_{n-1}}{3} \cup \left(\frac{2}{3} +\frac{C_{n-1}}{3}\right)$ with $C_0 = [0,1]$. Then $$\mathcal C = \bigcap_{n\in\mathbb N} C_n.$$

A set $E\subset \mathbb R$ is called a **Cantor set** if it is [[compact]], has empty [[interior]], and has no [[isolated point|isolated points]].
