A [[topological space]] $X$ is a **$k$-space** if every [[compactly closed]] [[subspace topology|subspace]] of $X$ is [[closed]].

Any [[topological space]] $X$ can be made a $k$-space by endowing it with a new [[topological space|topology]] in which a [[subspace topology|subspace]] is [[closed]] if and only if it is [[compactly closed]] in the original [[topological space|topology]]. The resulting space is denoted $kX$. The [[identity function]] $kX\to X$ is [[continuous]]. If $X$ is [[weak Hausdorff]], then so is $kX$, so $kX$ is [[compactly generated]] so that $X$ and $kX$ have exactly the same [[compact]] subsets.
