The **descending central series** of [[ideal of a Lie algebra|ideals]] of a [[Lie algebra]] $L$ is given by the [[derived Lie algebra|derived algebras]] $$\begin{align*}L^0 &= L\\ L^1 &= [L,L]\text{ } (= L^{(1)})\\ L^2 &= [L,L^1]\\ &\text{ }\text{ } \vdots\\ L^i &= [L,L^{i-1}]\\&\text{ }\text{ } \vdots\end{align*}$$ Where $L^{(1)}$ is the second element of the [[derived series of a Lie algebra|derived series]] of $L$.
