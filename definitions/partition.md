### Definition for sets
A **partition** of a set $X$ is a subset $\mathcal S$ of the [[power set]] $\mathcal P(X)$ such that 
1. $A\in \mathcal S$ implies that $A\neq \emptyset$;
2. For every $x\in X$, there is a unique $A\in \mathcal S$ such that $x\in A$. (Equivalently, the union of the sets $A\in \mathcal S$ is $X$ and the intersection of any two elements of $\mathcal S$ is empty.)
### Definition for [[rectangle|rectangles]]
A **partition** $P$ of a [[closed]] [[interval]] $[a,b]$ is a finite collection of points in $[a,b]$ such that $a,b \in P$.

More generally, a **partition** $P$ of a [[rectangle]] $Q$ in $\mathbb R^n$ is a collection $P = \{P_i\}_{i=1}^n$ of partitions of the [[component interval|component intervals]] $[a_i,b_i]$ of $Q$.
