### [[Lie Groups, Lie Algebras, and Represenations|Hall]] version
A [[topological space]] $X$ is **simply connected** if it is [[path-connected]] and for every two [[continuous]] maps $\gamma_1:[0,1]\to X$ and $\gamma_2:[0,1]\to X$ there exists a [[homotopy]] $F:[0,1]\times[0,1]\to X$ such that $F(x,0)= \gamma_1(x)$ and $F(x,1) = \gamma_2(x)$. 
### [[A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology|Concise]] version
A [[topological space]] $X$ is **simply connected** if it is [[path-connected]] and has trivial [[fundamental group]].
